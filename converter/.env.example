EDU_SHARING_USERNAME="admin"
EDU_SHARING_PASSWORD="admin"

# --- edu-sharing Source Template Settings
# Retrieve (whitelisted) metadata properties from an edu-sharing "source template" ("Quellen-Datensatz"-Template) and
# attach those metadata properties to each item. (This feature is DISABLED by default. Possible values: True / False)
# Before enabling this feature, make sure that:

#   (see: EDU_SHARING_BASE_URL setting above!)
# - AND contains the "ccm:oeh_crawler_data_inherit" property !
EDU_SHARING_SOURCE_TEMPLATE_ENABLED=False
# Define a separate "source template"-repository for testing/debugging. This setting is useful if

# CONTINUE_CRAWL=False
# EDU_SHARING_PRECHECK_SAVED_SEARCH_ID="<insert_your_saved_search_node_id_here>"

# ONLY use this mode if you wish to debug/complement/complete huge crawl processes which haven't completed on their own!

# --- Scrapy Pipeline settings:
# You can add one or more custom pipelines here to trigger.

# --- oeh_spider settings:
# Select the sources you want to fetch from OpenEduHub (comma seperated):
# OEH_IMPORT_SOURCES = 'oeh,wirlernenonline_spider,serlo_spider,youtube_spider'
