# follow these steps manually:
# activating the venv:
# source ./venv_z_api/bin/activate
# confirm that you are within your venv, then install the requirements.txt:
# pip3 install -r requirements.txt
#
# make sure that you have the OpenAPI Generator installed (and the PATH exposed within your ".profile")
# before running this command, otherwise the following steps WILL NOT WORK:

# change directories to project root:
cd ../../
# move the only relevant sub-directory to the "z_api"-directory at project root:
cp -r tmp/z_api/z_api/ z_api
# delete the temporary folder after everything is done:
rm -rf tmp
