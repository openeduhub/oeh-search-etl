https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/10121/overview;Leveraging Virtual Reality in a School Library;"<p>The module asks students to think beyond their current experiences in school libraries. &nbsp;We will look at content that is not specific to&nbsp;school, yet it will be the basis for discussions about how it might apply in future school library environments.&nbsp;You will ask your students to &quot;think out of the box&quot; for the moment then consider those futurist ideas when&nbsp;planning a space for today while knowing the space &nbsp;should be flexible enough to accommodate futuristic&nbsp;possibilities.&nbsp;</p>";"<p>McGonigal, Jane.&nbsp;<em>Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World</em>.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/10495/overview;Planning for Innovation: Renaissance or Renovation;"<p>In the third module we will consider tools for students to use to plan new school library spaces.&nbsp; This module along with Module 4 will expose students to structured ways to develop new ideas for not just renovating space but taking it in new directions. &nbsp; These modules are transitional, a way to move toward renaissance rather than mere renovation.&nbsp; Hopefully, they will provide a framework to explore ideas beyond their experience and the experiences of other planning team members. &nbsp;</p><p>After critically evaluating the advantages and limitations of either a Learning Commons or a Maker Space and considering futuristic ideas, let&rsquo;s focus on what might be an interim solution.&nbsp; What might be an affordable alternative that school libraries could be considering to enrich progressive, alternative educational models? &nbsp; We need to consider how to embed inquiry into new learning models while maximizing the space, the resources and the mentoring skills of a trained librarian.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of Modules 3 and 4 are to provide students with objective ways to step away from their preconceived library space designs and think about new concepts based on the user. &nbsp; We have moved space planning from a focus on housing the physical content to planning around the learning activities such as collaboration or team projects.&nbsp; The next logical step is to take a humanistic approach; planning for users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>";"<p>Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly.&nbsp;<em>Flow</em>.

They may decide that those are the models they want to explore as a library renovation but try to encourage them to come to that conclusion after working through a process focused on their students, how they want to work, and how they will want to work in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>In my OER Course Cognitive STEAM: Environments you can use the material on AEIOU Observation to introduce students to the skill of observing and taking notes on users within a library or other social environments that are frequented by their students.&nbsp; I also elaborate on this process in chapter 5 of my book, Library Spaces for 21<sup>st</sup> Century Learners. &nbsp; The OER Course or my book provide insight into developing a needs assessment document and translating those ideas into zone plans.&nbsp; Needs assessment documents along with a zone plan are standard tools they should be comfortable using to facilitate space planning discussions with an architect or interior designer. &nbsp; But in this course we are going to think of zone plans as maps not destinations.&nbsp; Zones are not spaces but rather an organizational tool for thinking through the planning process.&nbsp; In this course we will blur the edges of zones because they are based on activities not the people using the space. &nbsp;</p><p>Incorporating AEIOU observations into the needs assessment will enrich the document with examples of how the users are currently engaged in the space, how they modify the space to their needs and what existing furniture and equipment is being used most frequently and effectively. &nbsp;</p><p>If students are not using the library then they must go out and make observations where students are gathering, why those spaces work better than the library, what tools are leveraged, and how students demonstrate knowledge. &nbsp; It is also important to understand whether instructors use inquiry based learning skills in the classroom.&nbsp; If not, then they need to market inquiry based learning, suggest collaboration to integrate it into the curriculum and evaluate student results together. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Meaningful conversations with fellow instructors during the observation phase will help them select a team of collaborators to work on a needs assessment document for going forward. &nbsp; They can help the librarian determine what questions need to be asked about the nature of a future library.&nbsp; They can create excitement about possible changes to curriculum based on the new environments.&nbsp; &nbsp; They are stakeholders in this endeavor along with students, their parents and school administrators.&nbsp; All the stakeholders should be involved in developing a needs assessment document. &nbsp; Selecting an appropriate sized group that is representative of a majority of stakeholders is critical.&nbsp; They want divergent thinkers willing to offer opinions and be risk takers.&nbsp; They also want stakeholders who will ask their peers for insight to expand their personal views.&nbsp;</p><p>In this module you should also address some of the issues that a major renovation will require.&nbsp; Feasibility and viability issues like funding, technical infrastructure and human resources should all be addressed, documented and placed on a sidebar for later.&nbsp; These issues can be overwhelming and put a &ldquo;black hat&rdquo; on creativity so no new ideas are even explored.&nbsp; There are always numerous reasons why something new, innovative &ldquo;can&rsquo;t be done&rdquo; so spend some time letting people fill up a flip chart sheet with them.&nbsp; Then, decide as a group that they will not stop the planning process.&nbsp; After the group creates a compelling plan then the obstacles can be may efficiently addressed.&nbsp; The supporting arguments for change will emerge during the process, especially if the key driving factor is student learning.&nbsp;</p><p>In this module we are becoming social anthropologists studying our past for clues on how to make improvements for the future. &nbsp; The major obstacle they will all face is how to leave personal biases behind, acknowledge what your experiences tell you a school library or learning environment is.&nbsp; Hopefully, the group will include enough diverse experiences from invested stakeholders to suggest there can be more options than a single, traditional space.&nbsp; You also want to explore unique options specifically for your school for spaces, like a learning studio.&nbsp; &nbsp; The key question the students need to address is this: if you have never experienced an alternative environment, how would you know how to create it?&nbsp; Our experiences drive our knowledge and expectations; they also fuel opposition to innovative ideas.&nbsp; So lets find out what opportunities are hidden within your planning team.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>";graduate-professional;information-science;professional-development;en;AEIOU|Flow|Personal Bias|Zone Planning;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/;cc-by-sa;;;Module;student|teacher;2016-09-09T14:18:24
https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/10496/overview;Tell a Story and Add Immersive Planning;"<p>In this module we are going to look at an alternative way of thinking about environmental change.&nbsp; It is another tool to move the group toward alternative space planning.&nbsp; We are first going to explore the work of Doreen Massey, her thoughts on the multiplicity of space and how we are blinded by focusing on your single slice of time and function within a space.&nbsp; In what should appeal to all librarians, Massey talks about space as &ldquo;a story, a narrative&rdquo; that is continually being written.&nbsp;</p><p>We will also explore an &ldquo;Immersive Planning&rdquo; concept that Knoll Furniture has introduced into office and university space planning.&nbsp; The concept works equally as well in the school library environment but is currently not being leverage there.&nbsp; The process recognizes that space boundaries are becoming unclear because of the way users want to work.&nbsp; Defining a space with a single purpose has lost its functionality in today&rsquo;s world, or as Massey states space is a <em>&ldquo;multiplicity of trajectories&rdquo;</em>.</p>";"<p>Massey, Doreen. for space.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/10497/overview;Planning for Humans: User-Based Design;"<p><strong>Module 5 Planning for Humans, Users-based Design</strong></p><p>User based design is so logical and widely talked about today that it can be overlooked in designing alternative school library spaces.&nbsp; It is ultimately what this course is about. &nbsp;</p><p>We have discussed current solutions to the issue of what a school library should be, such as a Learning Commons.&nbsp; We have learned how to work around biases that can stifle creative, alternative solutions. We have looked at alternative tools to use when considering or planning space. &nbsp;Students have diagramed the trajectories that need to be considered in new library space,&nbsp;have overlaid those considerations with improvisational and dimensional elements. &nbsp; In this module we will bring all these pieces together and plan a space that will work in students&#39; individual&nbsp;school settings&nbsp;at this point in time based on the needs of their&nbsp;users. &nbsp;</p><p>However, those needs will not be fixed. Thinking you can design a space today for an extended period of time can not be your goal.&nbsp; Library space must have a multiplicity of trajectories.&nbsp; You must design for current user needs. Provide tools to build their base knowledge while watching down the road for the next information explosion, the tools it will require and decide how it will impact user needs.&nbsp; Leadership is really your goal.&nbsp; Adapting the space that users need to be successful is merely a an ongoing task.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>";<p>IDEO.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/122734/overview;Vocabulary control in IRS;<p>Vocabulary control is a crucial technique in oral and written discourse that manages the complexity and suitability of technical vocabulary, ensuring clarity and accessibility for the target audience. By selectively using particular words and expressions, vocabulary control simplifies comprehension, enhances vocabulary acquisition, and boosts confidence in language learners. In technical writing, it improves clarity, reduces ambiguity, and increases accessibility, while in translation, it guarantees accuracy, consistency, and efficiency. In writing for children, controlled vocabulary fosters a more accessible vocabulary, higher engagement, and vocabulary development. In Information Retrieval (IR) systems, vocabulary control is essential for accessing knowledge, informed decision-making, efficiency, research, and innovation. Various tools, such as thesauri, taxonomies, ontologies, controlled vocabularies, metadata standards, faceted classification, and keyword lists, facilitate vocabulary control. Classaurus, a hybrid of a thesaurus and classification system, is a powerful vocab control tool that organizes data and facilitates recall of relevant information. Understanding the differences between natural languages, which evolve organically, and artificial languages, which are designed for specific purposes, is also crucial in vocabulary control.</p>;;;graduate-professional;information-science;;en;Artificial Language|Classaurus|Natural Language|Need of Vocabulary Control|Tools of Vocabulary Control|Vocabulary Control;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/;cc-by-nc;;;Homework/Assignment;;2024-12-07T03:45:12

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21446/overview;Non-Violent Conflict Management: Conflict Resolution, Dealing with Anger, Negotiation and Mediation﻿;"<p>Conflict is inevitable and if unresolved, has negative impacts that reach far beyond the principal parties. Managing conflict in a non-violent manner can increase the ability of everyone involved to work more effectively with clients, staff, and other personnel. This module teaches conflict management through a combination of skill-building and philosophical discussion to enable participants to become invested in the idea that non-violent conflict management is better, more effective, and more efficacious in the long run than either conflict avoidance or an aggressive approach that produces &quot;winners&quot; and &quot;losers.&quot; The material can be presented in training sessions of varying lengths from one class to an entire semester.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/122949/overview;Models of information seeking behaviour;"<p>This abstract delves into the intricacies of information seeking behaviour by examining four influential models: Belkin&#39;s Anomalous State of Knowledge (ASK) Model, Krikelas Model, Savolainen&#39;s Everyday Life Information Seeking (ELIS) Model, and Wilson&#39;s Model of Information Behaviour. These models, developed between 1980 and 2008, offer distinct perspectives on the cognitive, emotional, and contextual factors that shape information seeking behaviour. The ASK Model highlights the anomaly-driven iterative search process, while the Krikelas Model emphasizes the interplay between information need, source selection, and external environmental factors. Savolainen&#39;s ELIS Model focuses on everyday life information needs and contextual influences, whereas Wilson&#39;s Model provides a comprehensive framework that integrates cognitive, emotional, and social aspects. This comparative analysis reveals the strengths and limitations of each model, underscoring their applications in crafting information retrieval systems, search engines, and community-oriented information services. By understanding the nuances of these models, researchers and practitioners can develop more effective strategies to support individuals&#39; information seeking endeavours in various contexts.</p>";;;graduate-professional;information-science;;en;Belkin's ASK Model|ELIS Model|Information Retrieval|IRS|Krikelas Model|Savolainen's ELIS Model|Wilson Model;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/;cc-by-nc;;;Homework/Assignment;;2024-12-12T08:32:02

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21433/overview;Enhancing Positive Outcomes in Transracial Adoptive Families﻿;"<p>This curriculum explores the experiences and challenges of transracial adoptive families with the goal of improving the quality of services and supports provided to them. In addition, there is a growing subset of transracial adoptive families who choose to maintain contact with their child&#39;s birth family. Very little information exists to help these families or their child welfare workers understand the bumpy terrain of openness. This curriculum fills some of the many gaps in knowledge and practice. It includes summaries of transracial adoption literature, a theoretical discussion on normative development in transracial adoptive families, practice-oriented information including discussion questions and exercises, case vignettes, worker guidance, a self-assessment tool, and findings from the in-depth qualitative study of 12 transracial adoptive families in California conducted as part of this project. Findings themes include: the complicated factors involved in choosing transracial adoption; how the children and youth understand the meaning of their adoption; issues around the choice to maintain contact with the adopted child&#39;s birth family, the role of the contact, and the vulnerability of contact arrangements; the role of race in family life and development, negotiating different cultural worlds, and developmental changes; and the role of services and supports prior to and following adoption.

In recent years, lawyers and those who train them have paid more attention to lawyer well-being. Over 30 years ago, law faculty and psychologists surveyed the mental well-being of law-students and found it abysmal. Continuing regional and national studies confirm this issue as one that needs addressing. A result is the creation of courses on mindful lawyering and mindfulness among law students. While perhaps not a groundswell, one needs more than just their two hands to count the number of law schools offering courses in this realm. This course showcases one version of a mindfulness course offered in one law school. Those attracted to teaching a similar course likely have a practice of their own, and indeed really need a practice to effectively teach the course. </span></span></span></p>";;;college-upper-division|graduate-professional;law;curriculum-instruction;en;Attorneys|Labyrinth|Law|Law School|Lawyers|Legal Education|Meditation|Mindfulness|Wellness;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/;cc-by;;;Full Course;student|teacher;2025-01-17T15:32:52

Many doctoral students, in particular, have questions about approaching and pursuing scholarly publications and presentations, collaborating with others, and finding their place in academia. The content of this booklet centers around the guiding principle and mindset of <i>Servant Scholarship</i>. A framework for <i>Servant Scholarship</i>&nbsp;that builds on established literature on the notion and practice of <i>Servant Leadership </i>is presented. Theoretical and practical guidance on participating with this framework in mind are presented to help scholars understand their roles in academia and choose a rewarding path. The metaphor of weaving a tapestry is utilized throughout to represent how individuals and groups of scholars contribute to lasting products and processes in academia over time.</span></span></span></span></p>";;;graduate-professional;information-science|arts-and-humanities|education;;en;;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/;cc-by-nc-nd;;;Lecture;;2024-05-31T13:20:26 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Teaching/Learning Strategy;;

This module focuses on formative assessment and how it can help educators to make student thinking visible and also how to use student ideas and models for teaching in the NGSS classroom.&nbsp; It builds on the work of the first two: Module #1 Phenomena &amp; Equity, Module #2 Talk &amp; Equity.</h2><h2>All Oregon Science Project Hybrid NGSS PD Modules are designed to be done together with other educators in real time either online or face-to-face. The Oregon Science Project utilizes the videoconferencing tools of Zoom to run small teams of K-12 educators through these modules online in real time. Some Oregon Science Project Learning Facilitators are able to meet with their teams in person and still use these modules on computers during face-to-face work.</h2><h2>It was built using the OER Commons Module builder so it is broken into units as Tasks. Some are meant to be done individually, while others are designed for group dialogue and interaction. Dialogue in this case is used as way to build shared understanding. This is compared to discussion where a group is working on making a decision or choice. This difference is based upon the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.thinkingcollaborative.com/"">Adaptive School Work of Garmston and Wellman.</a>&nbsp;You can read more about this in Chapter 4 of the Adaptive School: A Sourcebook for Developing Collaborative Groups.&nbsp;</h2><h2>The design of the modules and overall framework is also informed by the research about professional development from A Facilitator&#39;s Guide to Online Professional Development: Establishing Communities of Learning and Cultures of Thinking by Carol Brooks Simoneau and Gerald Bailey.</h2><h2><strong>Instructor Descriptions</strong></h2><h2>Accompanying each task is a backend &quot;Instructor Description.&quot; Each Instructor Description is only intended for the instructor or facilitator of the module and not the educator participating as a learner in the module.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/10107/overview;Who Owns the Writing Instruction?;"<p>With the adoption of the Common Core State Standards, The Next Generation Science Standards, and the C3 Framework for Social Studies State Standards, many middle and high schools require their content teachers to teach writing within their discipline area, often resulting in role confusion, anxiety, and resistance.</p><p>&ldquo;Teaching writing&rdquo; &ndash; the job of the ELA faculty - is confused with &ldquo;Teaching How to Write like a Historian, a Scientist, a Mathematician . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; - the job of the content faculty. Because content faculty are not usually trained in composition pedagogy, they may avoid writing instruction or worse &ndash; actually damage young writers by offering misguided instruction in mechanics and grammar.</p><p>Content faculty may be familiar with the writing conventions of their particular discipline. With raised awareness of their expertise and by identifying the rhetorical characteristics of their subject area, content faculty can learn&nbsp;instructional skills to support writing across the curriculum.</p><p>As a K-12 informational resource, the librarian holds a key position to raise awareness, reduce role confusion, provide instructional references, and improve writing school-wide. This module prepares pre-service librarians to understand and provide information to rectify the confusion of writing instruction across the secondary curriculum.</p>";<p>Materials for this module are embedded.</p>;"<p>Faculty can best prepare by researching issues surrounding the transition to writing across the curriculum. An excellent resource for teaching writing across the curriculum is Benjamin, A. (2005). <em>Writing in the content areas.</em> Eye on Education: Larchmont, NY.</p><p>At the end of this module, completers will demonstrate the following understandings:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All subject areas need to teach writing.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ELA faculty has specific knowledge, skills, and responsibility for composition instruction.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each discipline has its own writing conventions.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject-area teachers have&nbsp;responsibility to teach the writing conventions of their discipline.</p><p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp;Subject-area teachers can benefit by a) the clarification of their instructional role, b) awareness of their discipline&rsquo;s writing conventions, c) instructional resources particular to their field.</p><p>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;School Librarians have the skills and resources to raise awareness and provide instructional resources and assistance to help subject-area teachers with effective&nbsp;writing instruction.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adult learning theory informs effectiveness of professional development.</p><p>Prepare candidates for the module by re-framing and communicating the&nbsp;information from the Instructor&#39;s Overview to establish a purpose for completing the module in order to build the understandings listed above.&nbsp;</p><p>Instructor Notes:</p><p>This module is designed as a framework for one week of instruction. Instructors should note that as a framework, the module can be developed and extended to two or three weeks. Suggestions for further development:</p><p>After the first discussion board assignment, students could further explore the relationship between math/science content writing and ELA standards using the Venn Diagram found at NGSS@NSTA (n.d) &ldquo;Commonalities among the practices in science, mathematics, and English language arts.&rdquo; Based on work by Tina Chuek. ell.stanford.edu. Retrieved on October 31, 2016 from <a href=""http://nstahosted.org/pdfs/ngss/PracticesVennDiagram.pdf"">http://nstahosted.org/pdfs/ngss/PracticesVennDiagram.pdf</a></p><p>The assignment for the summative PD tool can be enriched and expanded in several ways. For instance, all content-based writing instruction requires the use of evidence. Librarian candidates could be required to add information and resources to support pedagogy for the styles of using evidence particular to each discipline, including citing and referencing. Similarly, all content writing requires two forms of exposition: argument and informational; the assignment could be enriched to include requirements to address these areas.</p><p>The module could extend beyond the construction of the PD tool by having candidates create lesson plans for informational support sessions to hold with content faculty to facilitate their discussion and exploration of resources. The support sessions would have the same learning objectives as the informational tool activity and be able to use the same rubric with small modifications.</p>";graduate-professional;information-science;curriculum-instruction;en;CCSS Literacy Standards|Composition|Content Area|Discipline-Related Writing|Instructional Librarian|Resource Librarian|Rhetorical Analysis|Subject-Area Conventions|Writing Across the Curriculum|Writing Conventions|Writing Instruction;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/;cc-by-nc-sa;;;Module;student|teacher;2016-08-02T15:10:08

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/17683/overview;APSAR: Anonymous Position Based Security Aware Routing Protocol for MANETs;"<p>In the last two decades, research in various aspects of mobile ad-hoc networks, MANETs, has been very active, motivated mainly by military, disaster relief and law enforcement scenarios. More recently, location information has become increasingly available; partially prompted by the emerging trend to incorporate location or position sensing into personal handheld devices. An evolutionary natural step is to adopt such position-based operation in MANETs. This results in what we call position-based MANETs. In such settings, devices are equipped with position-sensing capabilities and rely on position information in their operation. The main distinguishing feature of the envisaged position-based MANET environment is the communication paradigm based not on permanent or semi-permanent identities, addresses or pseudonyms, but on instantaneous node locations or positions. In some application settings, such as: military, law enforcement and search-and-rescue, node identities are not nearly as important as node positions. Such settings have certain characteristics in common. First, node position is very important: knowledge of the physical, as opposed to logical or relative topology, makes it possible to avoid wasteful communication and focus on nodes located within a speciﬁc area. Thus, the emphasis is not on the longterm node identity, but rather on current node position. Second, critical environments face security and privacy attacks. Security attacks aim to distribute false location and network ing control information, e.g., routing control messages, or impede the propagation of genuine information. The goal of privacy attacks is to track nodes as they move. Third, when the operating environment is hostile, as is the case in military and law enforcement settings, node identities must not be revealed. We use the term hostile to mean that communication is being monitored by adversarial entities that are not part of the MANET. The need to hide node identities becomes more pressing if we further assume that MANET nodes do not trust each other, due to a suspicious environment where nodes can be compromised. In such an environment, it is natural for node movements to be obscured, such that tracking a given node is impossible or, at least, very diﬃcult. While we do not claim that such suspicious and hostile location-based MANET environments are commonplace, they do occur and require high security and privacy guarantees. While doing all these;there is a challenge for nodes to maintain anonymity protection from outside observers or malicious attackers. Full anonymity protection can be achieved only when ;sources,destinations and routes all are protected. In this work, to oﬀer better anonymity protection, we propose an Anonymous Position-based Security Aware Routing Protocol (APSAR). Experimental results exhibit consistency with the theoretical analysis, and show that APSAR achieves better route anonymity protection compared to other anonymous routing protocols. Also, APSAR achieves comparable routing eﬃciency to the GPSR geographical routing protocol. The work in this thesis addresses a number of security and privacy issues arising in position-based MANETs. models. We address the problem of position based security aware routing in consideration with better anonymity protection .</p>";;;graduate-professional;engineering;curriculum-instruction;en;Congestion Window Size|NS-2|Packet Size;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/;cc-by-nc-nd;;;Module;student|teacher;2017-10-12T04:45:28

The most important challenge in wireless sensor networks is to design energy-efficient data gathering network which increases the life time of wireless sensor networks. In various studies, it is observed that processed data requires less power as compared to transmitting data in the wireless medium. Hence, it is more significant to apply compressed sensing algorithm at sensing node. Also, if Compressed Sensing (CS) is used with clustering method it will give significant power saving in wireless sensor networks (WSN). In this paper, we addressed comparison between energy saving obtained by changing random compressive sensing samples and without compressive sensing.</p>";;;graduate-professional;engineering;curriculum-instruction;en;Compressive Sensing|Wireless Sensor Networks;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/in/;cc-by-nc-nd;;;Module;student|teacher;2017-10-25T00:19:08

The main constraint in wireless sensor network is its energy consumption and limited battery life of the sensor nodes. Coverage provides good quality of service but it is very important especially when combined with connectivity and energy efficiency. This paper&nbsp;provides some existing coverage protocols with their limitations. The proposed algorithm for the overlap area provides better coverage efficiency of 91.354% than the existing robust PEAS protocol that provides coverage efficiency of approximately 80% to 88% thus allowing&nbsp;the minimum number of sensor nodes to be in the active state in order to conserve energy thereby increasing the lifetime of the sensor node.</p>";;;graduate-professional;engineering;curriculum-instruction;en;Protocols|Wireless Sensor Network;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/in/;cc-by-nc-nd;;;Module;student|teacher;2017-11-01T01:02:34

Findings showed that the implementation of CWS/CMS did not lead to drastic changes in the ways in which CWSs carried out their daily work; time spent with clients was unchanged. However, the study demonstrated that CWS/CMS led to modest but crucial changes in how workers spent their time on the job, affected the quantity and quality of relationship with coworkers, and changed some workers&#39; attitudes toward their agency and job.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21429/overview;Factors Leading to Premature Terminations of Kinship Care Placements﻿;"<p>This curriculum focuses on factors that may lead to differential placement outcomes for children who have become dependents of the court, as the result of abuse and neglect, and have been placed with kin rather than in traditional foster homes. It is intended for use by child welfare faculty in California&rsquo;s schools of social work or social welfare in both BSW and MSW programs and may be used in direct practice or Human Behavior and the Social Environment (HBSE) classes. In addition, the curriculum, or parts from it, may be used in workshops provided to line workers, supervisors, and/or managers by any of the public child welfare training academies in California or public child welfare agencies. The intent of this curriculum is to provide students and child welfare professionals with (a) background information on kinship care as an alternative to traditional foster care, (b) a brief review of the literature pertaining to the characteristics of dependent children in kinship care and their care providers, (c) opportunities to discuss beliefs about why kinship care is valuable (or not) and why it may or may not be successful, (d) demographic data pertaining to selected characteristics of children in kinship care and their care providers derived from a sample of California child welfare cases, (e) factors which may or may not be related to premature termination of kinship care placements, (f) caregiver perceptions of differential placement outcomes, (g) social worker perceptions of differential placement outcomes, and (h) opportunities to discuss how students and/or child welfare workers can decrease premature termination of kinship care placements. The curriculum is accompanied by a PowerPoint presentation containing key points from each module followed by one or more slides presenting an &ldquo;active learning experience.&rdquo; (78 pages)&nbsp;</p><p>Chang, J., Liles, R., &amp; Hoang, T.

After the third viewing, students are asked to focus specifically on two dialogue<br />scenes that differ between the two videos and create a list of noticings. They can use<br />this list to note the way the videos changed, or to create their own questions for their<br />classmates who are watching the segment(s) for the first time.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/16743/overview;User Centered School Library Design;"<p>If we take a constructivist approach to learning in libraries, then library spaces should be responsive to student needs. As Theodore Creighton points out in <a href=""http://www.oercommons.org/courses/setting-the-stage-for-staff-development-uniting-constructivist-teaching-and-learning-environments/view"">Setting the Stage for Staff Development</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;the teacher&rsquo;s responsibilities involve creating classroom environments where students think, explore, and construct meaning, while including opportunities for students to have social interaction.&quot; &nbsp;Similarly, library spaces, which allow support for both classes and &quot;free-range&quot; learning should do the same. &nbsp;In a previous OER Commons module by this author on <a href=""https://www.oercommons.org/courseware/module/10582"">library space design</a>, students studied methods for gathering student input into design. The next step is to begin incorporating that input into the actual design process and to apply input to&nbsp;the space as a whole. &nbsp; Too often librarians start with furniture rather than starting with the purposes and mission of the program and space. As Malcolm Brown points out,</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Creating a vision for learning and learning spaces is a powerful leverage point; it informs almost all other decisions about learning space design. A vision also allows us to effectively articulate to all constituents what we are trying to accomplish. The vision helps organize all participants in the design and implementation of these spaces as well as the activities they support. Simply installing wireless access points and fresh carpeting isn&#39;t enough if done in isolation; such improvements pay real dividends only if they are in concert with the institution&#39;s overall teaching and learning objectives.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href=""https://www.educause.edu/research-and-publications/books/educating-net-generation/learning-spaces"">Learning Spaces</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Prospective librarians may not have a current space to design, but they can begin envisioning space as a construct that incorporates user needs and wants and that drives program goals, and begin to think about spaces as a whole. &nbsp; This module particularly focuses on ideas contained in the book <strong>Language of School Design</strong>(Nair and Fielding) and work by Ewan McIntosh (notosh.org). &nbsp;Both works &nbsp;ask library designers to think of spaces in terms of zones and how those zones make a variety of student learning possible. &nbsp;A series of readings and recordings will provide an introduction to these concepts with examples. &nbsp;</p><p>School Librarian Competencies , 4, 5, and 10</p><p><a href=""http://researchguides.austincc.edu/c.php?g=554360&amp;p=3891603"">http://researchguides.austincc.edu/c.php?g=554360&amp;p=3891603</a></p><p>ISTE Educator Standards &nbsp;2 and 5</p><p><a href=""https://www.iste.org/standards/standards/for-educators"">https://www.iste.org/standards/standards/for-educators</a></p>";;;graduate-professional;information-science|higher-education;professional-development;en;Design Thinking|Learning Commons Design|Learning Spaces Design|Library Design;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/;cc-by-nc-sa;;;Module;student|teacher;2017-09-10T12:13:35

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/18297/overview;Wireless sensor network- energy efficient data gathering.;"<p><strong>Abstract&mdash; Wireless sensor networks are mainly resource constrained with less memory space, limited power supply, processing speed and availability of bandwidth for communication. One of the most important challenges in wireless sensor networks is to design energy-efficient data gathering&nbsp;a network which increases the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. Due to an enormous deployment of sensors, a tremendous data is<br />generated by these sensor networks. Processing and transportation of such a huge data increase the energy consumption of sensor nodes along with an increase in network traffic. It is observed that processed data requires less power as compared to transmitting data in the wireless medium. Hence, it is more significant to apply compressed sensing algorithm at sensing node. Compressive sensing (CS) technique generates a sparse signal of few nonzero samples from the original signal at sub-Nyquist sampling rate where reconstruction of the original signal is possible even with few sparse samples. Thus, all the necessary and more accurate<br />information can be obtained from the data gathered by wireless sensor networks with less number of samples. In this paper, we compare three types of data gathering technique.</strong></p>";;;graduate-professional;engineering;curriculum-instruction;en;Compressive Sensing|Digital Signal Processing|Sub-Nyquist Sampling Theorem|Wireless Sensor Network (WSN);http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/in/;cc-by-nc-nd;;;Module;student|teacher;2017-11-01T03:18:46

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/18019/overview;E-APSAR:Enhanced Anonymous Position Based Security Aware Routing Protocol For Manets;<p>In the past few years, we have seen a rapid expansion in the field of mobile computing due to the pro- liferation of inexpensive, widely available wireless devices or networks.However, all these networks are conventional wireless networks as they require a fixed network infrastructure with cen- tralised administration for their operation, potentially consuming a lot of time and money for set-up and maintenance.Drawbacks of conventional wireless networks are driving a new alternative way for mobile communication, in which mobile devices form a selfcreating, self-organising and self-administering wireless network, called a mobile ad hoc network.In mobile ad-hoc networking (MANETs), nodes communicate to each other based on public identities. In this paper,for a position based routing[22] an innovative packet forwarding mechanism is proposed in which source node generates route request packet and broadcast packet to other neighbor nodes to locate destination by implementing black hole attack[8]. Proposed E-APSAR (Enhanced Anonymous Position Based security aware routing protocol) is implemented on NS-2 and results shown significant improvement over original DSR in terms of various performance metrics.

To help World Language Educators accomplish this, the Nebraska Department of Education invited experienced world language teachers across the state to create student-friendly assessments in the form of can-do statements in the summer of 2023.&nbsp;This document is a student-friendly self-assessment activity for Advanced Low world language learners created based on the 2019 Nebraska World Language Standards. The language use described in all can-do statements is meant for the target language, except for the second for standard 3.1 and the first for standard 4.2.&nbsp;It is recommended that world language teachers engage students with this document three times in an academic year: pre-course, mid-course, and post-course. Engaging students with this self-assessment activity will help students see growth over time and hopefully attribute growth to effective learning practices.

How can we design assessment tasks that elicit student&rsquo;s current understanding of specific aspects of the disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts in order to shape future instruction? In this workshop, participants will learn how to interpret and design cognitive formative assessment to fit a three-dimensional view of learning.</p><p>This resource originates from a series of PD sessions on 3D formative assessment developed and provided by Katie Van Horne, Shelley Stromholt, Bill Penuel, and Philip Bell. It has been improved through a collaboration in the ACESSE project with science education experts from 13 states.

But with the need to store volumes and variety of data (unstructured) in recent years, non-relational database technologies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (document-oriented, graph based, column based, key-value and hybrid) have emerged to address the requirement that allow data to be grouped together more naturally and logically. One of the most popular ways of storing data is a document-oriented database, basically employed for storing, managing and retrieval of semi-structured data where each record and its associated data is considered of as a &ldquo;document&rdquo;.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/15750/overview;NGSS4Baker5J Module #1 - Introduction & Framework;"<p>The Oregon Science Project was created in response to Oregon educators&#39; desires to understand the NGSS and how it may look in our classrooms. These new standards are more than a&nbsp;restructuring of the previous content standards. The 3 dimensions of NGSS shifts the classroom work toward the students&#39; sense-making of phenomena. Students then model scientific processes as they seek to understand the awe-inspiring piece of the world around us.&nbsp;</p><p>The modules and process we are embarking on are&nbsp;designed to help us as educators explore <strong>what it means for our students to &#39;do&#39; science</strong>. This process will be messy, vague, and uncomfortable at times, and asks each of us to contribute in order to generate productive work. The work throughout this year will be a combination of monthly in-person or online meetings, using OSP Modules,&nbsp;group discussion, and group designed formats.</p><p>Here is the (draft) skeleton&nbsp;<strong>schedule</strong>: (subject to change depending on participants&#39; needs)</p><p>Module #1:&nbsp;Introduction &amp; Framework - Who are we as a group? Why teach science? Why teach science in our community? How does science work? How does NGSS shift the science process?</p><p>Module #2: Phenomena - What are phenomena? Why are they central to an NGSS classroom? How do you decide what is productive phenomena?</p><p>Module #3: Making our students&#39; thinking visible&nbsp;- How do we use productive discourse in the classroom? How do we model and teach paraphrasing?&nbsp;</p><p>Module #4: Equity - How do we engage all students in Science?&nbsp;</p><p>Module #5: Science Talk - Why is Science Talk important?</p><p>Module #6: Science Talk - What does Science Talk look like in the classroom?</p><p>Module #7: Science Talk - How do we increase Science Talk? How do we show others?</p><p>Module # 8+: Coming soon!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Structure: </strong>Prior to each meeting, participants will be gifted with insightful media to provoke&nbsp;thoughts, questions, and ideas to prepare each for meeting. Each meeting, participants will share, discuss, and do activities that relate to the Module topics and questions. We will have approximately 8-10 meetings from October 2017 to April 2018.&nbsp;</p>";;;graduate-professional;education;professional-development;en;NGSS;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/;cc-by;;;Module;student|teacher;2017-07-19T17:12:58

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/108684/overview;Compassionate Integrity Training Manual;"<p>Compassionate Integrity Training (CIT) is a multi-part training program that cultivates basic human values as skills for the purpose of increasing individual, social, and environmental flourishing. By covering a range of skills from self-regulation and self-compassion to compassion for others and engagement with complex systems, CIT focuses on and builds toward compassionate integrity: the ability to live one&rsquo;s life in accordance with one&rsquo;s values with a recognition of common humanity, our basic orientation to kindness, and reciprocity. Unlike some definitions of integrity that focus on mere consistency with one&rsquo;s values, without examining what those values are, compassionate integrity insists that consistency with one&rsquo;s values is not enough if those values promote harm to oneself, others, or the world. Instead, maintaining and increasing consistency with one&rsquo;s values is most beneficial when they are values that promote one&rsquo;s own well-being as well as that of others. As to what those values are and how we understand them, this is arrived at by investigating and examining things for oneself, using common sense, shared experience, and science.</p><p dir=""ltr"">&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">&nbsp;</p><p><br />&nbsp;</p>";;;high-school|community-college-lower-division|college-upper-division|graduate-professional|adult-education;education;;en;Common Humanity|Compassion and Empathy|Integrity and Ethics|Interdependence|Peacebuilding|Systems Thinking|Trauma-informed Care;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/;cc-by;;;Reading;student|teacher|administrator|parent|librarian|other;2023-09-19T12:27:56 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Student Guide;;

There is no general consensus amongst experts on how to most effectively apply digital game-based learning to garner the most improvement for student achievement. With such a lack of guidance, educators are open to deciding when and how often to use DGBL.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/16487/overview;Ethics, Equity, and Critical Information Literacy in the School Library;"<p>While school librarians typically are well exposed to issues surrounding censorship and selection, less attention is paid to the ethics of librarianship and how those play out in the specialized context of school libraries. Attention to the ALA Code of Ethics and the ALA Bill of Rights set the foundation for careful reflection on the role of the school librarian, particularly in relation to the role of libraries in a democratic society.</p><p>Issues of equity are [inherent] in library service and attention to the dimensions of meaning and implications of the word &ldquo;equity&rdquo; is warranted. This module situates equity in the context of educational equity, and the alignment of libraries as gateways to opportunity and education as the pathway to opportunity. School librarians may or may not have opportunities to explore the contexts of &ldquo;intellectual freedom&rdquo; in relation to equity.</p><p>The codification of information literacy in the American Library Association Presidential Committee on Information Literacy Final Report in 1989 paved the way for information literacy to &ldquo;become the predominant way to frame the educational role of libraries and librarians.&rdquo; (Seale, 2013, &ldquo;The Neoliberal Library&rdquo; in Gregory and Higgins) As such, inquiring into the complexities and nuances of intellectual freedom and equal access to information is essential to understanding the school librarian&rsquo;s role and responsibilities.</p><p>Library and school library publications are increasingly recognizing the relevance of social justice to librarianship, as evidenced by a survey of library journals this past year. (example: &ldquo;Equality vs. Equity&rdquo; theme, <strong>Knowledge Quest</strong>, Volume 45, No. 3, January/February, 2017; &ldquo;Social Justice Symposium&rdquo; by Erin Hooper in <strong>VOYA</strong>, June 2017) Recognizing the power of the librarians to not only hold space for critical discourse but to also impact the shape and tenor of that discourse is the first step to fully owning the responsibility that comes with that power.</p><p>A particularly relevant and useful resource is&nbsp;<strong>Information Literacy and Social Justice: Radical Professional Praxis</strong>, edited by Lua Gregory and Shana Higgins, Library Juice Press, 2013</p><p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></p><p>Participants will model, coach, and support &quot;efficient and ethical information-seeking behavior&quot; &nbsp;(Standard 3: Information &amp; Knowledge 3.1)</p><p>Participants will support flexible, open access for library services and model and communicate the legal and ethical codes of the profession. (Standard 3: Information &amp; Knowledge&nbsp;3.2)</p><p>Participants practice the ethical principles of their profession, advocate for intellectual freedom and privacy, and promote and model digital citizenship and responsibility. (Standard 5: Program Management and Administration 5.2)</p><p>Participants will understand, model, and share how open education practice brings a transformative shift from a proprietary and industrial education model to a participatory education model.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/16323/overview;Self-talk During Inquiry: Helping novice researchers productively shape metacognition;"<p>Experienced researchers &ldquo;get&rdquo; inquiry - that is, they have an ongoing internalized self-talk process that evaluates, draws connections, and creates next steps for the information-gathering process. But, they may not know <em>that </em>or<em> how</em> they do it.</p><p>Along with the steps of inquiry, we need to help learners understand the metacognitive &quot;self-talk&quot; that guides their decisions which drive the inquiry. What researchers <em>think</em> is more important than what they <em>do.</em> So how can we help researchers recognize and utilize their metacognitive processes that guide their research? In order to prepare information-age learners, librarians need tools to teach the thinking that lies behind the inquiry.</p><p>In this module, librarian candidates will learn to make the internalized reflective process overt. Candidates will create metacognitive awareness of the reflection process that accompanies inquiry. They will demonstrate understanding by creating concrete reflection scaffolding tool for emerging researchers.</p><p>The skills and understandings gained from this module will help school librarians build instruction in support of CCSS.ELA-Literacy.

Teachers and students face challenges related to technological literacy. To address these challenges, investing in infrastructure, providing professional development, and developing digital skills in students are important. Blended learning, incorporating face-to-face and online activities, is a potential solution. Theories like constructivism and Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy can guide teaching. Flexible approaches such as project-based learning and the flipped classroom, along with technology tools and resources, support technology literacy.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/8468/overview;Creating librarian-teacher partnerships: Roles of school principals and school librarians;"<p>This module offers school principals and school librarians the opportunity to build and strengthen understanding and skills toward collaborative instruction with the school librarian and classroom faculty. This module is also appropriate for graduate candidates in school leadership and/or school librarian programs.</p><p>This module is based on the British University learning model. In England, Small groups of learners meet once a week with a &quot;tutor&quot; - AKA professor to discuss relevant topics, share their work, submit assignments and get feedback. While the faculty suggests resources, learners are expected to conduct research to find their own. This model is especially applicable to school library and school principal candidates who need to build research skills for on-going professional development in the field. Librarians, of course, always need to hone their research skills.</p><p>Like the British model, learning for this program is largely self-guided. Resources are provided for the learner to develop expertise demonstrated in three major assignments: a white paper, a tri-fold pamphlet, and an analysis of a case study.</p><p>Candidates must demonstrate and justify competence in targeted ISLLC and ALA Standards to successfully complete the module. This competence is assessed by a rubric used by the candidate for self-assessment and by faculty for performance assessment .</p><p>Because the learning for this module is largely self-guided, faculty needs to be available for consultation through regularly scheduled office hours&nbsp;and email. The goal of this consultation is to provide coaching and explanation. Faculty will use the Discussion Board Task&nbsp;as formative assessment to guide facilitated instruction and coaching. Summative assessment is demonstrated by the three artifacts produced in the module.</p>";<p>List of resources</p><p>Principal and Librarian Standards and competency Rubrics</p><p>Description of assignments</p><p>Competency rubrics for artifacts</p>;"<p>Familiarize yourself with specific language of the competency rubrics.</p><p>Determine through reflection and conversations with colleagues exactly what the rubric criteria indicates so you know it when you see it and can provide coaching and guidance when you don&#39;t.</p><p>Familiarize yourself with the resources on the list provided to candidates.</p><p>Develop a list of your own recommended resources.

California&rsquo;s statewide shortage of social workers is expected worsen, and the field of public child welfare is facing its own acute shortage of social work personnel. More important, high turnover rates in child welfare agencies are a major obstacle to timely investigations, compromising the ability of agencies to protect children. The retention of public child welfare workers is an immediate pressing professional and practical concern, and this curriculum points directly to specific solutions to the problem.&nbsp;(58 pages)</p><p>Weaver, D., Chang, J., &amp; Gil de Gibaja, M.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21560/overview;Lane Science Project Module #3: Whole-group facilitation;"<h2><em><strong>This version of LSP&nbsp;Module 3 preserves the &quot;Whole group&quot; aspects of Module 3 for use in the third LSP session (currently scheduled in April). The original OSP Module 3 was designed to alternate between individual work and facilitator-led group sessions (which would include small group/breakout work over its course). LSP Module 3 (distributed to the ambassadors)&nbsp;was rewritten to alternate between individual work and small-group dialogues, with the whole-group, facilitator-led segments eliminated or altered. They should be brought back into the mix during the whole-group meeting.</strong></em></h2><h2>This is the third in a series of Hybrid NGSS Modules curated&nbsp;by the Oregon Science Project in 2017 <strong>using already created, research-based NGSS professional development resources</strong>. This module focuses on formative assessment and how it can help educators to make student thinking visible and also how to use student ideas and models for teaching in the NGSS classroom.&nbsp; It builds on the work of the first two: Module #1 Phenomena &amp; Equity, Module #2 Talk &amp; Equity.</h2><h2>All Oregon Science Project Hybrid NGSS PD Modules are designed to be done together with other educators in real time either online or face-to-face. The Oregon Science Project utilizes the videoconferencing tools of Zoom to run small teams of K-12 educators through these modules online in real time. Some Oregon Science Project Learning Facilitators are able to meet with their teams in person and still use these modules on computers during face-to-face work.</h2><h2>It was built using the OER Commons Module builder so it is broken into units as Tasks. Some are meant to be done individually, while others are designed for group dialogue and interaction. Dialogue in this case is used as way to build shared understanding. This is compared to discussion where a group is working on making a decision or choice. This difference is based upon the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.thinkingcollaborative.com/"">Adaptive School Work of Garmston and Wellman.</a>&nbsp;You can read more about this in Chapter 4 of the Adaptive School: A Sourcebook for Developing Collaborative Groups.&nbsp;</h2><h2>The design of the modules and overall framework is also informed by the research about professional development from A Facilitator&#39;s Guide to Online Professional Development: Establishing Communities of Learning and Cultures of Thinking by Carol Brooks Simoneau and Gerald Bailey.</h2><h2><strong>Instructor Descriptions</strong></h2><h2>Accompanying each task is a backend &quot;Instructor Description.&quot; Each Instructor Description is only intended for the instructor or facilitator of the module and not the educator participating as a learner in the module.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/90897/overview;Dance;"<p>In the world today there is a lot of attention to dance many people love to do it. Some do it professionally some do it for fun and socializing. For socializing and having fun the best dances are social latin dances. One of them is salsa and the other is bachata. These dances are similar in some ways but there are many ways they are different as well. I will talk about the differences now and let you choose which one fits you better. The differences between bachata and salsa are really big! If you&rsquo;ve heard Latin music before you know the difference right away. The timing is the same in both dances, but salsa music tends to be faster y picante (spicy), bachata is slower and kind of suave (smooth), it&rsquo;s a romantic dance. The basic steps for each of them are completely different. In salsa you have a straight line for the basic steps while in bachata you have latteral movements. Unlike salsa, in bachata dance there are no turns, instead, you bring your partner in close the whole time. Now it is your turn you know some of the major differences between two dances select one of them.</p>";;;middle-school|high-school|community-college-lower-division|college-upper-division|graduate-professional;world-cultures;;en;;https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/;public-domain;;;Reading;;2022-03-11T10:16:27

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/22092/overview;How to Avoid All Possible Types of Plagiarism in Writing;"<p>Plagiarism definitions are many:</p><p>When it comes to spoken words, plagiarism means stealing ideas and thoughts of other people to claim them as one&#39;s own. Speaking of written words, plagiarism is defined as a lack of original content in a writing piece.</p><p>Dictionaries call plagiarism &quot;stealing and passing off ideas or words of another as one&#39;s own,&quot; and &quot;presenting as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source.&quot; (<a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plagiarizing"">Merriam-Webster</a>)</p><p>Plagiarism is a persistent problem. People do it unknowingly or willingly, and a large percentage of accusations corresponds to the academic world: students plagiarize writings for many reasons, use all possible types of this offensive act, and don&#39;t realize all the consequences. What they should try to do is be aware of plagiarism and avoid it in academic writings, citing and referencing their works accordingly.</p><h1>What are plagiarism types?</h1><p>The digital era calls the shots, so today we have many new forms of plagiarism, both intentional and unintentional ones. Academic and journalistic are the general names for plagiarism types, but both involve several variations. They are as follows:</p><ul><li><h2>Full plagiarism</h2></li></ul><p>Also known as <em>&quot;direct&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;complete&quot; plagiarism</em>, this form appears when you copy the content from a source as it is, word for word.</p><p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> no original research, no changes in lexical items or punctuation, no differences (even the tiniest ones) between two content pieces.</p><p>Full plagiarism is the sin of incompetent authors or those who are mere lazy to give it their best shot and create something original. Speaking of the academic world, full plagiarism leads to a student&#39;s expulsion.</p><ul><li><h2>Paraphrasing</h2></li></ul><p>Some call it <em>&quot;partial&quot; plagiarism</em> because it happens when a writer takes data from several different sources, combines them with minor changes in language, and represent as original ideas. Paraphrasing itself is not plagiarism, and it&#39;s okay to use it if citing and referencing all sources. But it becomes so when represented as a rewrite of the original with no attributions.</p><p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> presenting the ideas from original sources in different forms, changes of sentence structure, active to passive voice manipulations, no cites or references.</p><p>In the case of paraphrasing, an author takes pains to sound original and yet doesn&#39;t provide any first-hand research in his writing. In academia, this form of plagiarism signals about a lack of knowledge on the topic or not enough writing skills to expand ideas.</p><ul><li><h2>Minimalistic plagiarism</h2></li></ul><p>It&#39;s a kind of <em>paraphrase</em> too, but a more professional one: a writer copies ideas but changes the flow and order in which they are presented in the source. This form of plagiarism is difficult to detect because it does seem original, especially if checked with plagiarism detection software.</p><p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> changes in sentence structure, statements order, and writing style of the source; paraphrasing several sources in one text with no attributions; active use of synonyms.</p><p>Minimalistic plagiarism happens when a student lacks time or patience to create original work but is ambitious of recognition and high grades.</p><ul><li><h2>Mosaic plagiarism</h2></li></ul><p>Also known as a <em>poor rewrite, synonymization, or patch writing</em>, mosaic plagiarism happens when an author takes phrases from the original, rearranges them in order, and represent in own work without citing. Or, when he keeps the same sentence structure and meaning but replace every word with synonyms so his work would look like a newly written one.</p><p><strong>Characteristics: </strong>rearrangements in word and phrase order, excessive synonymization, a flow changes, no attribution to sources.</p><p>Students do love this type of plagiarism, and it&#39;s most common in their academic works. Mosaic plagiarism signals about procrastination, lack of knowledge, and ignorance of plagiarism consequences.</p><ul><li><h2>Accidental plagiarism</h2></li></ul><p>In plain English, it&#39;s <em>unintentional copying</em> of others&#39; ideas and words. Speaking of students, they might fall into a trap of accidental plagiarism when don&#39;t know they borrow concepts from others and, therefore, neglect to reference sources because they do consider their writings original.</p><p>Despite its accidental nature, this form of plagiarism is considered as copyright infringement and scholar ethics violation. So, the consequences are going to be as ominous as in the case of other plagiarism types.</p><ul><li><h2>Self-plagiarism</h2></li></ul><p>The trickiest one, self-plagiarism occurs when a student decides to submit his previous work to another class. Or, when he takes ideas, concepts, and passages from his other essays and use them for new assignments with no permission from both professors.</p><p>This form is the most controversial one, and many still argue if they should consider it plagiarism at all. On the one hand, your work is your intellectual property, and so you can use it wherever you want. On the other, this work is no longer original after you&#39;ve submitted it. It&#39;s a kind of bluff: the audience waits for new information from an author, but he misleads them and gives something they&#39;ve heard already.</p><p>In the world of academia, it would be wise for students to consult professors on the institution&#39;s policies to make sure it&#39;s okay to cite papers, previously submitted to other classes.</p><ul><li><h2>Source plagiarism, or wrong referencing</h2></li></ul><p>Authors refer to each other in their works. And when a student refers to a cited source rather than a primary one, it&#39;s called <em>source plagiarism</em>.</p><p>Source formatting matters, either. Improperly cited sources, false referencing, or no references at all are the cases of plagiarism. Reasons for why a student avoids references in a paper vary:</p><ul><li><p>He asked a ghostwriter to create an essay, so he just can&#39;t refer to it.</p></li><li><p>He used a source to steal arguments and just copied them with no changes.</p></li><li><p>He used the essence of a source and just changed several keywords.</p></li><li><p>He combined several sources in a paper for it to look original.</p></li></ul><p>It often happens that a student doesn&#39;t know how to use citations and references in his copy. It&#39;s not the case of plagiarism, but a professor may consider it so when detecting some misinformation in a list of references. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>Using wrong sources (see the above source plagiarism).</p></li><li><p>Neglecting footnotes: a student cites an author but doesn&#39;t provide a location of the source.</p></li><li><p>Using fake sources: a student plagiarizes the entire text of his essay and yet provides a long list of references to &quot;prove&quot; its original nature.</p></li></ul><p>Proper citation is a must in the academic world, so writers need to know how to use and structure references to avoid accusations of plagiarism.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>How to avoid plagiarism issues in writings?</h2><p>Plagiarism consequences are many, and most are not as evident as students might think. Copyright infringement and intellectual property theft are legal issues, and they might lead to far stronger effects than poor grades or reputation loss. To avoid them, stop believing all myths about plagiarism in academia and start doing in-depth research on assigned topics. It will allow understanding key concepts and structure a future essay right.</p><p>Other tips on avoiding plagiarism in writing:</p><ul><li><p>Document every source you use. Make sure to format it right: don&#39;t forget about quotation marks when citing someone&#39;s words.</p></li><li><p>Spare no time on research.</p></li><li><p>When in doubts, ask peers to check your list of references and say if you format it right. The same goes for research: friends might help to find proper sources or recommend some.</p></li><li><p>Never ask anyone to write essays for you: any ghostwriters, any custom services, any downloads from the web.</p></li><li><p>PRO tip: after you completed writing a paper, run it through a <a href=""https://plagiarismcheck.org"">pro commercial software</a> that will find unintentional plagiarism in your text.</p></li></ul><p>Plagiarism is about ethics and principles. It&#39;s not enough to know the definition and consequences of the issue to avoid it. What matters is your determination: stay honest, do research, create original works for more people to learn new ideas, refer to other authors, and remember to mention their names when citing.</p>";;;college-upper-division|graduate-professional;language-grammar-and-vocabulary;curriculum-instruction;en;Plagiarism|Plagiarism Types|Types of Plagiarism;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/;cc-by-sa;;;Module;student|teacher;2018-03-26T09:32:01

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21425/overview;Pathways to Collaboration: Factors That Help and Hinder Collaboration Between Substance Abuse and Child Welfare Fields﻿;"<p>Research over the past decade has documented a strong relationship between substance abuse and problems of child abuse and neglect. Although many data collection systems do not gather accurate data on substance abuse and child welfare, most studies in the U.S. suggest parental substance abuse is a factor in one third to two-thirds of child involvement in the child welfare system. Parental substance abuse appears to be strongly associated with higher rates of physical abuse or neglect among families in community samples, higher rates of substantiated child maltreatment in cases referred into child welfare, higher rates of out-of-home placements, re-reports of abuse, and reentry into foster care. This study examined factors that help and hinder the process of collaboration based on in-depth interviews with respondents from substance abuse and child welfare fields working in five California counties with established formal collaborative policies and programs. This curriculum, which is grounded in the findings from the study, provides highlights of research and experiential activities in four primary areas that may be used independently or in combination: (a) overview of research on cross-systems collaboration, (b) promising models and elements for collaborative practice, (c) factors that help and hinder collaboration, and (d) facilitating communication and dealing with confidentiality issues across systems.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/11131/overview;Visual Aids in Teaching History;"<p>This resource by Dr Agnes DCosta helps to learn about the use of maps and timelines in teaching of History.&nbsp;</p>";;"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MAPS</strong></p><p>A map is a two dimensional representation of any place on the earth. David Rumsey writes Historical maps often hold information retained by no other written source, such as place-names, boundaries, and physical features that have been modified or erased by modern development.</p><p>&nbsp;Historical maps capture the attitudes of those who made them and represent worldviews of their time. Political maps and physical maps are both useful in history.&nbsp; Historical maps depict the kingdoms of the past. Eg historical map of the Maratha kingdom.</p><p><strong>Use and importance &nbsp;of Maps in teaching history</strong>:</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maps help to see the area where the event occurred. They give the historical event a background from Geography. Eg: One can understand Shivaji&rsquo;s guerilla warfare better if one is familiar with the geography of Maharashtra.</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maps help to get an idea of distance between places important in History. They give an idea of the extent of a country or the extent of the kingdom of a ruler. One can learn History better through use of a map. For example all places where the Harappa Civilization existed were near the river banks . Hence we get an idea of the life of the people.&nbsp; The student of history must not only be aware of the geographical location of the event but also of the influence of geographical factors on man in his environment.</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kingdoms of the past can be compared with present maps to see which area of the past is being discussed in History. For example, the Mughal Empire extended from present day Afghanistan to present day Bangladesh. At a glance the reader is taught and reminded of the great shifts of frontiers which characterise the past and to a degree the present.</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A comparison between two maps helps to understand political events. Eg Comparing the map of Europe before and after world war I gives insight into the events of world war I.</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many cause effect relationships in History are understood through maps. Eg considering&nbsp; the Treaty of Versailles and the division of Germany due to this treaty gives an idea of why Hitler began World War II. If one needs to understand why British were famous for their explorations by sea, one should be familiar with the map of Britain. The Greek culture is best understood by understanding the geography of Greece through its map.</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maps help top see how the present has evolved from the past. Students need to be reminded that the present world has its roots in the past.</p><p>Watch this video for maps related to Indian History</p><figure data-type=""video"" data-width=""640"" data-height=""360"" data-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN41DJLQmPk"" class=""oembed"" style=""width: 640px; min-height: 360px;""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>TIMELINES</p><p>A timeline is a linear representation of various events that have occurred in history. All events in history can be represented using a timeline. Generally we have a timeline depicting events from one topic eg. Time line of Mughal period, timeline for events of World War I etc. A time line can be verbal or in the graphic form. Two timelines can be used simultaneously to compare the events in two parts of the world during the same period. Eg timeline of India and Europe during the 17<sup>th</sup> century. This can help to understand history comparatively.&nbsp;</p><figure data-type=""video"" data-width=""640"" data-height=""360"" data-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8SawDIV1Ck"" class=""oembed"" style=""width: 640px; min-height: 360px;""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><figure data-type=""video"" data-width=""640"" data-height=""360"" data-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wKZslhlfa4"" class=""oembed"" style=""width: 640px; min-height: 360px;""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Use and significance of using a timeline:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting events in order helps students to understand the overall development of a particular event and to understand the development of an historical era. Eg they can see how the world war slowly progressed from a war between two nations to a war among many nations.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; A timeline allows the students to see how historical events are related and points out the cause and effect relationship between historical events.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; It helps to understand the concepts of A.D and B.C more clearly. Many children get confused as in B.C era time is calculated backward. A timeline helps to dispel misconceptions.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; It helps to remember the chronological sequence of different events. It helps students situate newly encountered events and figures in relation to those they&rsquo;ve already studied</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Timelines help to recognize how historic events, eras and topics overlap in time. Eg a comparison of Mughal and Maratha timelines can help to see how certain events were significant in both these regimes.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Students can use timelines to categorize similar or related events into themes, eras, and topics, and compare elements in different time periods. Thus abstract concepts become concrete with a&nbsp; time line.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>";graduate-professional;education;curriculum-instruction;en;Maps|Timelines;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/;cc-by-nc-sa;;;Module;student|teacher;2016-10-15T23:34:15

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/17142/overview;Freewriting for International Students;"<p>All too often international graduate students become paralyzed when asked to write in a Western academic context.&nbsp; They are concerned about their grammar and formatting and they lose sight of the assignment&#39;s meaning and purpose.&nbsp; In addition, the students, who already have an undergraduate degree related to their field of graduate study, often forget about their content area&nbsp;expertise in their concern for producing &quot;correct&quot; work for their professors in their graduate classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginnign phases of recognizing writing as a process,&nbsp;researcher Peter Elbow examined the uses of freewriting in his classrooms, calling it the best way to get out ideas in a disorganized fashion so that the editing and organizing can go on later in the writing process. (Elbow 1973)&nbsp; He likens the freewriting process to the use of voice; a writers voice must be formulated and created before it can be molded and shaped (Elbow 1973).&nbsp;Therefore, freewriting is one of the biggest gifts to give international students so they can find their voice and create authentic text in later drafts.&nbsp; Remind the students of their expertise in the field via allowing for free expression of ideas through the use of free writing.&nbsp; It is a first step for the students in creating the academic texts that will be necessary throughout their academic careers.</p><p>Resource: <u>Writing Without Teachers</u>.

The language use described in all can-do statements is meant for the target language, except for the second for standard 3.1 and the first for standard 4.2.&nbsp;It is recommended that world language teachers engage students with this document three times in an academic year: pre-course, mid-course, and post-course.

It is hypothesized that geriatric patients, like children, would also benefit the most from games or from a conversation that is unrelated to therapy; however, games will likely be more beneficial for alleviating stress due to games being able to distract the client from the therapy session better than conversation can. This research would ask the following question: Are games more effective in alleviating frustration for geriatric patients during therapy sessions than conversations unrelated to therapy? </span></span></span></p>";;;graduate-professional;health-medicine-and-nursing;;en;;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/;cc-by;;;Reading;;2024-06-25T14:14:29

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/10589/overview;Becoming a Leader through Action Research: Building Open Education Practice in the School Library;"<p>The role of the school librarian is evolving from&nbsp;keeper of library materials to leader in school reform. The digital age has elevated &nbsp;information literacy from the mechanics of searching and finding&nbsp;to thinking and inquiry. To meet this challenge the&nbsp;library facility is reconceptualized as a&nbsp;learning environment&nbsp;and the collection as&nbsp;a&nbsp;dynamic process of&nbsp;curation and access. Library staff, including paraprofessionals, student peers, and parent volunteers are viewed as instructional support. Allocated budgets are supplemented by funding sources such as grants and donations.&nbsp;The school&nbsp;librarian, trained in Action Research,&nbsp;can realize the library as learning center as she systematically collects evidence, sets priorities, and constructs a Strategic Plan.&nbsp;This module&nbsp;brings together the processes of action research, including identifying a problem in practice, formulating a research question, collecting and analyzing data to&nbsp;conduct a Community Scan and School Library Needs Assessment. She will apply her findings to building a Strategic Plan that will transform the school library into a learning center, or improve its existing functions.</p>";"<p><strong>Introduction to the Module</strong></p><p>Action Research is a a skill set you can use to solve a problem in your instructional practice, such as, &quot;How do I set priorities for my first year as school librarian?&nbsp;You can use action research to learn about the community-at-large in which your school is located. This is called a Community Scan. You can also conduct a needs assessment using action research to determine your priorities for your first year. You may decide to improve the&nbsp;library facilitywith your school community in improving the learning environment of the&nbsp;library, or curating a library&nbsp;collection of open educational resources that supports school curriculum and students&#39; personal interests and issues. In this module we are focusing on building a &nbsp;knowledge about your school library by acquiring a skill set that will help you generate evidence for your decision-making.&nbsp;</p><p>This is what Action Research looks like:</p><p><img width=""480"" height=""360"" alt="""" src=""https://www.oercommons.org/editor/images/124"" /></p><p>The Action Research Spiral is continuous and ongoing.The problem becomes a research question such as How can I motivate high school students to read more in the summer, The research tells us that students who do not engage in summer reading lose 3 months of on their reading scores which has a cumulative effect on their reading comprehension.</p><p>The fieldwork is the heart of Action Research. These are the ways to collect evidence through, for example, a survey of what high school students like to read. Your analysis of the survey responses will inform the survey questions. &nbsp;Your reflection on your Action Research will bring you to a better understanding of what the solution looks like. Since most of your students will probably say they do their reading on the web, you may decide to create an intervention, such as a&nbsp;summer reading website for them.</p><p>How will you know at the end of the summer that your intervention made a difference? You could administer a post-survey that asks the students questions about their summer reading.</p><p>Lastly, when you digest all of this evidence you could find that the post-survey revealed that while 75% of students did read more, 25% showed no difference at all. This is a new problem that triggers the Action Research Cycle. You may want to form focus groups, or groups of students are part of the 25%. Your questions to these groups will be help you understand who these &quot;non-readers&quot; are and how you can help them.</p><p>Action research is systematic and scientific, and you don&#39;t have to use inferential statistics to reach this level of confidence. You do not have to worry about whether your &quot;sample&quot; of students, for example, is representative, or if it is large enough. You don&#39;t even have to worry about whether your can apply, or generalize what you learn to every child in the USA. Action research is LOCAL; the students you are studying are your population,&nbsp;not a representation of a population. However, action research is concerned with whether your findings are valid, or true, and whether they are reliable, or can be replicated. The methods you will learn in this module will ensure both of these standards for research.</p><p>In this module we are going to begin to focus on questions that new school librarians face when they enter their school library for the first time. The lectures for this module are as follows:</p><p>1. Action Research Meets Strategic Planning: Bringing Process and Product Together [ppt]</p><p>2. Conducting&nbsp;a Community Scan [ppt] &nbsp;</p><p>3. Doing&nbsp;a School Library Needs Assessment [ppt]</p><p>4. Building a Strategic Plan [ppt]</p><p>5. What&#39;s Next? Planning Year Two [ppt]</p><p>Action Research contributes the processes for collecting and analyzing data so that the school librarian begin to set priorities. The Strategic Plan is the product, or end result, that consists of a Vision Statement for the library, a Mission Statement, and Goals and Objectives for Year One.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>";"<p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></p><p>Students will create a Strategic Action Plan for their school libraries by:</p><p>1. Using&nbsp;the methods of action research to formulate a question and&nbsp;collect and analyze data. The Strategic Action Plan contains &nbsp;a community scan, a school scan,&nbsp;and a needs assessment of their school library.</p><p>2. Creating a vision and&nbsp;mission statement that embodies the beliefs of open education resources and practice: inclusiveness, collaboration, participation, equity of access to resources and instruction/help.</p><p>3. Creating&nbsp;goals and objectives that result in&nbsp;building of&nbsp;a school library environment that advances&nbsp;open-education practice and resources for collection building, curriculum design and program development, an inclusive instructional team among library staff, and expanded funding concepts&nbsp;beyond the allocated budget.</p>";graduate-professional;information-science;curriculum-instruction|professional-development;en;Action Research|School Libraries|Strategic Planning;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/;cc-by-nc-nd;;;Module;student|teacher;2016-09-18T13:01:44

The first leaf shows signs of canker, characterized by raised, rough lesions on the surface. The second leaf displays dot disease, marked by small, dark circular spots. The third leaf represents mummification, where part of the leaf appears shriveled or dried up. The fourth leaf illustrates rust, identifiable by reddish-brown spots or pustules scattered across the surface. Finally, the last image is of a healthy guava leaf, which appears green and free from any visible diseases.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21651/overview;NGSS4Baker5J Module #6 - Formative Assessment for Equity;"<h2>This is the third in a series of Hybrid NGSS Modules curated&nbsp;by the Oregon Science Project in 2017 <strong>using already created, research-based NGSS professional development resources</strong>. This module focuses on formative assessment and how it can help educators to make student thinking visible and also how to use student ideas and models for teaching in the NGSS classroom.&nbsp; It builds on the work of the first two: Module #1 Phenomena &amp; Equity, Module #2 Talk &amp; Equity. (We in the Baker Cohort have broken down these Modules further. The Oregon Science Project has designed&nbsp;Module #3, and we have broken it down into&nbsp;Modules #6 &amp; 7.)</h2><h2>All Oregon Science Project Hybrid NGSS PD Modules are designed to be done together with other educators in real time either online or face-to-face. The Oregon Science Project utilizes the videoconferencing tools of Zoom to run small teams of K-12 educators through these modules online in real time. Some Oregon Science Project Learning Facilitators are able to meet with their teams in person and still use these modules on computers during face-to-face work.</h2><h2>It was built using the OER Commons Module builder so it is broken into units as Tasks.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/17685/overview;Nanomaterials;"<h3>Introduction</h3><p><strong>What are nanomaterials?</strong></p><p>Nanomaterials have unanimously settled on a precise definition given by Scientists. They are partially characterized by their small size in nanometers. &nbsp;One millionth of a millimeter approximately 100,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair is called nanometer.</p><p>From a variety of products nano-sized particles exist in nature and can be created, for instance, carbon or minerals like silver, but nanomaterials by definition must have at least one dimension less than approximately 100 nanometers. Most of the nanoscale materials are too small to be seen with the naked eye and even with conventional lab microscopes.</p><p>Upon converting the nanomaterials as engineered materials from a variety of products they have shown unique optical, magnetic, electrical, and other properties. These emergent properties have the potential for great impacts in electronics, medicine, and other fields. For example,</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nanotechnology is being used to design target oriented pharmaceuticals to target organs or cells in the body such as cancer cells, and enhance the effectiveness of therapy.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In cement, cloth and other materials to make them stronger and yet lighter the nanomaterials are being used.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of their small size they are extremely useful in electronics, and they can also be used in environmental remediation or clean-up to bind with and neutralize toxins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Engineered nanomaterials on the other hand have provided great benefits on human health and the environment. Even well-known materials, such as silver for example, may pose a hazard when engineered to nano size.</p><p>Fibrous nanomaterials made of carbon have been shown to induce inflammation in the lungs in ways that are similar to&nbsp;asbestos. Nano-sized particles can enter the human body through inhalation and ingestion and through the skin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Where are nanomaterials found?</strong></p><p>Nature has produced some nanomaterials, such as blood borne proteins essential for life and lipids found in the blood and body fat.&nbsp; Scientists, however, are particularly interested in engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), which are designed for use in many commercial materials, devices and structures. &nbsp;Already, thousands of common products-- including sunscreens, cosmetics, sporting goods, stain-resistant clothing, tires, and electronics&mdash;are manufactured using ENMs. They are also in medical diagnosis, imaging and drug delivery and in environmental remediation.</p><p><strong>Synthesis of nanomaterials</strong></p><p>Mainly there are two types:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Top-Down Approach</em>. Another way to think about this is &ldquo;making big stuff smaller.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Bottom-Up Approach</em>. &nbsp;Another way to think about this is &ldquo;making small stuff bigger.&rdquo;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Top-Down Approach</h3><p>By the top-down approach the&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://sustainable-nano.com/2013/05/23/kids-learn-about-nanodiamonds-and-i-learn-about-kids/"">nanodiamond</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;is made.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://sustainable-nano.com/2014/02/18/the-atomic-difference-between-diamonds-and-graphite/"">Nanodiamond is nearly pure carbon</a>.&nbsp; Nanodiamond is&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://sustainable-nano.com/2014/01/23/nuclear-proliferation-sustainability-the-history-of-nanodiamonds/"">made by detonation (explosion)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.hielscher.com/ultrasonic-synthesis-of-nanodiamonds.htm"">ultrasonication (using sound waves to break up materials) of bulk graphite flakes</a>: This method of synthesis converts millimeter-size flakes of graphite into nanoscale diamond particles.&nbsp; The process costs some energy and does not sound very controllable, but if all goes well, you will get nanodiamond particles that are about 5 nanometers in diameter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://hamers.chem.wisc.edu/"">Bob Hamers&rsquo; group</a>&nbsp;is working on ways to chemically modify nanodiamond particles so they will be stable in water for our biological experiments.</p><p><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shapetype id=""_x0000_t75""  coordsize=""21600,21600"" o:spt=""75"" o:preferrelative=""t"" path=""m@4@5l@4@11@9@11@9@5xe""  filled=""f"" stroked=""f"">  <v:stroke joinstyle=""miter""/>  <v:formulas>  <v:f eqn=""if lineDrawn pixelLineWidth 0""/>  <v:f eqn=""sum @0 1 0""/>  <v:f eqn=""sum 0 0 @1""/>  <v:f eqn=""prod @2 1 2""/>  <v:f eqn=""prod @3 21600 pixelWidth""/>  <v:f eqn=""prod @3 21600 pixelHeight""/>  <v:f eqn=""sum @0 0 1""/>  <v:f eqn=""prod @6 1 2""/>  <v:f eqn=""prod @7 21600 pixelWidth""/>  <v:f eqn=""sum @8 21600 0""/>  <v:f eqn=""prod @7 21600 pixelHeight""/>  <v:f eqn=""sum @10 21600 0""/>  </v:formulas>  <v:path o:extrusionok=""f"" gradientshapeok=""t"" o:connecttype=""rect""/>  <o:lock v:ext=""edit"" aspectratio=""t""/>  </v:shapetype><v:shape id=""Picture_x0020_6"" o:spid=""_x0000_i1025"" type=""#_x0000_t75""  alt=""https://sustainablenano.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/1-graphite-into-nanodiamonds.png""  style='width:226.5pt;height:114.75pt;visibility:visible'>  <v:imagedata src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image001.png""  o:title=""1-graphite-into-nanodiamonds""/>  </v:shape><![endif]--><img width=""302"" height=""153"" alt=""https://sustainablenano.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/1-graphite-into-nanodiamonds.png"" src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image002.gif"" /></p><h3>Bottom-Up Approach</h3><p>By a bottom-up approach, the gold nanoparticles&nbsp;are made.&nbsp; It uses water-soluble form of gold, known as a gold salt, HAuCl<sub>4</sub>.&nbsp; This gold salt produces H<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;and AuCl<sub>4</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>&nbsp;ions when dissolved in water.&nbsp; Later add a chemical compound called a reducing agent, which converts the gold ions into elemental gold atoms. These gold atoms are not as soluble in water, and so clump together into nano-sized particles. I have illustrated this below, and I am just showing 4 gold compounds to illustrate the chemistry: The problem here is that as those gold atoms form nano-sized lumps of gold, they have a tendency to continue to grow into bigger, non-nano-sized lumps.&nbsp; If we are not careful, we just form big flakes of gold:</p><p><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id=""Picture_x0020_9""  o:spid=""_x0000_i1026"" type=""#_x0000_t75"" alt=""https://sustainablenano.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/2-gold-nanoparticle-formation-diagram.png""  style='width:398.25pt;height:134.25pt;visibility:visible'>  <v:imagedata src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image003.png""  o:title=""2-gold-nanoparticle-formation-diagram""/>  </v:shape><![endif]--><img width=""531"" height=""179"" alt=""https://sustainablenano.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/2-gold-nanoparticle-formation-diagram.png"" src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image004.gif"" /></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Structure of nanomaterials</strong></p><p>Nanomaterials&nbsp;describe, in principle, materials of which a single unit is sized (in at least one dimension) between 1 to 1000 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"">nanometres</a>&nbsp;(10<sup>&minus;9</sup>&nbsp;meter) but usually is 1 to 100&nbsp;nm.</p><h2>Types of Nanomaterials</h2><p>For the purpose of this article, most current nanomaterials could be organized into four types:</p><p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carbon Based Materials</p><p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metal Based Materials</p><p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dendrimers</p><p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Composites</p><h2>Carbon Based Materials</h2><p>These nanomaterials are composed mostly of carbon, most commonly taking the form of a hollow spheres, ellipsoids, or tubes. Spherical and ellipsoidal carbon nanomaterials are referred to as fullerenes, while cylindrical ones are called nanotubes. These particles have many potential applications, including improved films and coatings, stronger and lighter materials, and applications in electronics.</p><h2>Metal Based Materials</h2><p>These nanomaterials include quantum dots, nanogold, nanosilver and metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide. A quantum dot is a closely packed semiconductor crystal comprised of hundreds or thousands of atoms, and whose size is on the order of a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers. Changing the size of quantum dots changes their optical properties.</p><h2>Dendrimers</h2><p>These nanomaterials are nanosized polymers built from branched units. The surface of a dendrimer has numerous chain ends, which can be tailored to perform specific chemical functions. This property could also be useful for catalysis. Also, because three-dimensional dendrimers contain interior cavities into which other molecules could be placed, they may be useful for drug delivery.</p><h2>Composites</h2><p>Composites combine nanoparticles with other nanoparticles or with larger, bulk-type materials. Nanoparticles, such as nanosized clays, are already being added to products ranging from auto parts to packaging materials, to enhance mechanical, thermal, barrier, and flame-retardant properties.</p><h2>Unique Properties</h2><p>The unique properties of these various types of intentionally produced nanomaterials give them novel electrical, catalytic, magnetic, mechanical, thermal, or imaging features that are highly desirable for applications in commercial, medical, military, and environmental sectors. These materials may also find their way into more complex nanostructures and systems. As new uses for materials with these special properties are identified, the number of products containing such nanomaterials and their possible applications continues to grow.</p><h2><strong>Types of Nanomaterials</strong></h2><p>There are mainly two types of nanomaterials. They are</p><ul><li>Fullerenes</li><li>Nanoparticles</li></ul><h3>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Fullerenes</strong></h3><p>Fullerenes are actually grapheme sheets rolled in the form of spheres and are actually a class of allotropes of carbon. A main example of fullerene is carbon nanotubes. They are known for their mechanical strength and their good electrical conductivity. Take a look at the fullerene structure given below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.circuitstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Fullerene-Structure.jpg""><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape  id=""_x0000_i1027"" type=""#_x0000_t75"" alt=""Fullerene Structure"" style='width:114.75pt;  height:114.75pt' o:button=""t"">  <v:imagedata src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image005.jpg""  o:href=""http://www.circuitstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Fullerene-Structure.jpg""/>  </v:shape><![endif]--><img width=""153"" height=""153"" alt=""Fullerene Structure"" src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image006.jpg"" /></a></p><p>Fullerene Structure</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/webprojects2002/mjames/c60b.jpg"">Image Source</a></p><p>Fullerenes are mainly used in the medical field as they are known for binding certain types of antibiotics to the structure of resistant bacteria. They are also found to be resistant against melanoma, at type of cancer cell. All these are possible only because of the good physical and chemical properties of fullerenes. They are also known for their high resistance and superconductivity properties. Thus, they also find great applications as light-activated antimicrobial agents.</p><p>Fullerenes are obtained by inserting a large amount of current in between two very close graphite electrodes in an atmosphere that is inert in nature.</p><p>From the reaction a carbon plasma arc is obtained in between the electrodes, which then forms as a residue. This residue is then converted to obtain fullerenes.</p><h3>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Nanoparticles</strong></h3><p>Nanoparticles are made from metals, semiconductors, and other particles that have great chemical, physical, electrical and magnetic properties. Nanoparticles find its main application as chemical catalysts.</p><p>Nanoparticles have a size so small, that they actually lie between the bulk materials and the molecular structures. &nbsp;As a result they possess some of the properties of the bulk materials as well as molecular structures.</p><p>To know the special properties of nanoparticles, let us compare the bending if bulk copper with that of copper nanoparticles. If bulk copper is bent, the movement of copper atoms/clusters is approximated to be at the 50 nm scale. At the same time, copper nanoparticles which have sizes below 60 nanometres will not have the same ductility like bulk copper. Also, when the size decreases, they are known to be very hard.</p><h3>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Sol-gel</strong></h3><p>Sol-gels are also considered as nanomaterials for some applications. It finds its main application in some fields like material science and ceramic engineering. The actual process for producing sol-gel is called Chemical Solution Deposition. Such a wet-chemical process is used mainly for the fabrication of metal oxide. Te process starts with a chemical solution, which acts like a precursor. The most common precursors used are metal alkoxides and metal chlorides. These precursors undergo severe reactions to produce a network called &ldquo;elastic solid&rdquo;. Such an elastic solid will be a complex system which includes amorphous submicrometer particles dispersed to various degrees in a host fluid.</p><h3><strong>Characteristics of Nanomaterials</strong></h3><p>The main characteristics of nanomaterials like size and shape were observed during the early 1900&rsquo;s. The main study was done by Zsigmondy, who made detailed studies of nanomaterials that were lesser than 10 nanometers in size. As most of these particles are much smaller than the wavelength of light, an ultramicroscope was used for seeing them.</p><p>Different types of techniques are employed to characterize the nanoparticles. The most different assessment is in finding the size characteristics. Most of the nanoparticles that are expected to be in the nanometre range actually aggregated in solutions. Even light scattering method, ultrasound attenuation spectroscopy, and so on are used to determine the size and also for knowing the concentrated nano-dispersions.</p><p>Other characteristics of nanoparticles like surface charge and zeta potential is also found out using certain methods. All these characteristics have to be found out so as to determine the stabilizing point of the material, aggregation prevention point and so on. Some of the common methods that are used to find the characteristics are colloid vibration current method , microelectrophoresis, electrophoretic light scattering and so on.</p><h3><strong>Safety regulations of Nanomaterials</strong></h3><p>One of the main reasons for developing nanomaterials is to save the health of people by the advanced treatment methods the material can provide. The material is good enough in providing advanced targeted methods in delivering drugs. They are also advantageous in detecting diseases in the early stage of its formation. They can also be used for cancer therapy. But apart from all these advantages, they are also known to produce side effects.</p><p>A different type of approach must be made to test and know the effects of nanomaterials on human body and also on the environment. As the behaviour of nanomaterials is very different from any other small-sized particle The OECD Chemicals Committee has formed a Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials who are to study the different effects of the material and bring about the different safety regulations.</p><p>One of the main effects of nanomaterials is the increased rate of absorption. When the nanomaterials are manufactured, the ratio of their surface area to volume increases, and causes the rate of absorption to go up through the human skin, lungs and even the digestive track. The main point is that the particles must be absorbed in very small quantities so as to avoid health hazard.</p><p>The safety regulations do not only concern the people who are applied with, but also the workers who provide it. In order to provide safety, the Swedish Karolinska Institute, conducted different experiments by adding different nanoparticles like iron oxide, zinc oxide, copper oxide and titanium dioxide into human lung epithelial cells. Out of these iron oxide nanoparticles were found to produce a little DNA damage and were non-toxic. Zinc oxide was known to be more toxic and copper oxide is known to be the most toxic material.</p><p><strong>CARBON NANO TUBES (CNT) Technology Overview</strong></p><p>The discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in 1991 opened up a new era in materials science. These incredible structures have an array of fascinating electronic, magnetic and mechanical properties. CNT are at least 100 times stronger than steel, but only one-sixth as heavy, so nanotube fibers could strengthen almost any material. Nanotubes can conduct heat and electricity far better than copper. CNT are already being used in polymers to control or enhance conductivity and are added to anti-static packaging.</p><p>A carbon nanotube is a tube-shaped material, made of carbon, having a diameter measuring on the nanometer scale. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter, or about 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. CNT are unique because the bonding between the atoms is very strong and the tubes can have extreme aspect ratios. A carbon nanotube can be as thin as a few nanometers yet be as long as hundreds of microns. To put this into perspective, if your hair had the same aspect ratio, a single strand would be over 40 meters long.</p><p>Carbon nanotubes have many structures, differing in length, thickness, and number of layers. The characteristics of nanotubes can be different depending on how the graphene sheet has rolled up to form the tube causing it to act either metallic or as a semiconductor. The graphite layer that makes up the nanotube looks like rolled-up chicken wire with a continuous unbroken hexagonal mesh and carbon molecules at the apexes of the hexagons.</p><p><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape  id=""_x0000_i1028"" type=""#_x0000_t75"" alt=""Carbon nanotube made from rolled graphene sheet""  style='width:326.25pt;height:129.75pt'>  <v:imagedata src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image007.png""  o:href=""http://www.nanoscience.com/files/9113/7781/8576/CNT.png""/>  </v:shape><![endif]--><img width=""435"" height=""173"" alt=""Carbon nanotube made from rolled graphene sheet"" src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image008.gif"" /></p><p><strong>Schematic of carbon nanotube made from rolled graphene sheet</strong></p><p>There are many different types of carbon nanotubes, but they are normally categorized as either single-walled (SWNT) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNT). A single-walled carbon nanotube is just like a regular straw. It has only one layer, or wall. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes are a collection of nested tubes of continuously increasing diameters. They can range from one outer and one inner tube (a double-walled nanotube) to as many as 100 tubes (walls) or more. Each tube is held at a certain distance from either of its neighboring tubes by interatomic forces.</p><p><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape  id=""_x0000_i1029"" type=""#_x0000_t75"" alt=""Single vs multi-walled CNT"" style='width:204.75pt;  height:177.75pt'>  <v:imagedata src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image009.png""  o:href=""http://www.nanoscience.com/files/4613/7782/2890/Screen_Shot_2013-08-29_at_4.32.56_PM.png""/>  </v:shape><![endif]--><img width=""273"" height=""237"" alt=""Single vs multi-walled CNT"" src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image010.jpg"" /></p><p><strong>Single vs multi-walled CNT</strong></p><p>Currently, the most popular use for carbon nanotubes is in structural reinforcement. The high strength and low weight of CNT combined with their flexibility allow for them to be added to other materials like rebar to concrete. Advances are being made using carbon nanotubes to extract power from sunlight and even as a heat source. Carbon nanotubes are unique in that they are thermally conductive along their length but not across the tube itself. This lets carbon nanotubes play a role on both sides of thermal insulation. CNT are also highly electrically conductive, which could potentially make for an extremely cost effective replacement for metal wires. The semiconducting properties of CNT make them candidates for the next generation of computer chips. Other applications under investigation are their use as chemical carriers for pharmaceutical applications. Specific drugs can be attached to CNT that can target and attack only certain types of cells, including cancer cells, for example.</p><p>It is important to note that growth of carbon nanotubes in general always requires the presence of a catalyst. The catalyst is usually predeposited on the surface on which growth will take place. The catalyst can also be suspended in a hot gas stream and nanotube formation will occur that way as well, though the latter is a very inefficient way to do so. It also should be mentioned that it is possible to inject both a hydrocarbon compound and a catalyst-bearing compound simultaneously into a CVD system and get growth without prepatterning the substrate. An example would be injecting toluene and ferrocene simultaneously, in which case the growth is characterized as a two-source process and would require two injection mechanisms operating simultaneously as well as a carrier gas injection assembly. The single source precursor that comes with the SSP354 is much simpler, less expensive and more reliable to use.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>";;;graduate-professional;applied-science;professional-development;en;Composites|Dendrimers|• Fullerenes • Nanoparticles;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/in/;cc-by;;;Module;student|teacher;2017-10-12T06:23:59

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21295/overview;Use of Cultural Brokers As an Approach to Community Engagement With African American Families in Child Welfare.;"<p>This empirically based curriculum addresses a number of issues related to disparity and disproportionality experienced by African American families involved with child welfare. It is well documented that for decades African American children have been overrepresented in child welfare throughout this country. Yet little is known about what strategies might be implemented in order to reverse this phenomenon. This curriculum is based on findings from a Community-Based Participatory Research Project that brought together African American community leaders and university faculty to examine both the historical evolution and prominent features of a cultural broker approach to promote engagement and partnership with the African American community and the county child welfare agency. This curriculum provides research highlights, historical perspectives, conceptual frameworks, approaches for community engagement, tools and experiential opportunities to strengthen social worker understanding, and knowledge and skills regarding issues related to disproportionality and disparity experienced by African American families in child welfare. It addresses five areas: the history of cultural racism and oppression in child welfare, the prevalence of racial disparities and disproportionality in child welfare, the role of community partnership and collaboration with African American families in child welfare service delivery, the cultural broker approach to community engagement in child welfare practice, and key considerations for improved child welfare partnerships with African American communities.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/18058/overview;Wireless Sensor Network;"<p>For paper 1:&nbsp;Abstract&mdash; Wireless sensor networks (WSN) consist of tiny sensor nodes scattered on a relatively large geographical area. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are low cost, low-power, multifunctional sensor nodes that are small in size and communicate untethered in short distances. The WSN nodes are used in numerous applications in different areas including military, health, industry and ecology. However, there are several restrictions such as low capability of computation, limited energy resources, unreliable channels, and the power consumption. This paper proposes different constraints and the solution for the same.</p><p>For paper 2:&nbsp;Abstract&mdash;Main constraints of wireless sensor networks (WSN) are less memory space, limited power supply, processing speed and availability of bandwidth for communication. The most important challenge in wireless sensor networks is to design energy-efficient data gathering network which increases the life time of wireless sensor networks. In various studies, it is observed that processed data requires less power as compared to transmitting data in the wireless medium. Hence, it is more significant to apply compressed sensing algorithm at sensing node. Also, if Compressed Sensing (CS) is used with clustering method it will give significant power saving in wireless sensor networks (WSN). In this paper, we addressed comparison between energy saving obtained by changing random<br />compressive sensing samples and without compressive sensing.</p><p>For paper 3:&nbsp;Abstract&mdash; Wireless Sensor Networks constitute a wide range of applications related to national security, military, surveillance, health monitoring environment. The main constraint in wireless sensor network is its energy consumption and limited battery life of the sensor nodes. Coverage provides good quality of service but it is very important especially when combined with connectivity and energy efficiency. This paper provides some existing coverage protocols with their limitations. The proposed algorithm for the overlap area provides better coverage<br />efficiency of 91.354% than the existing robust PEAS protocol that provides coverage efficiency of approximately 80% to 88% thus allowing minimum number of sensor nodes to be in the active state in order to conserve energy thereby increasing the lifetime of the sensor node.</p><p>For paper 4:&nbsp;Abstract&mdash; Wireless sensor networks are mainly resource constrained with less memory space, limited power supply, processing speed and availability of bandwidth for communication. One of the most important challenges in wireless sensor networks is to design energy-efficient data gathering network which increases the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. Due to an enormous deployment of sensors, a tremendous data is generated by these sensor networks. Processing and transportation of such a huge data increase the energy consumption of sensor<br />nodes along with an increase in network traffic. It is observed that processed data requires less power as compared to transmitting data in the wireless medium. Hence, it is more significant to apply compressed sensing algorithm at sensing node. Compressive sensing (CS) technique generates a sparse signal of few nonzero samples from the original signal at sub-Nyquist sampling rate where reconstruction of the original signal is possible even with few sparse samples. Thus, all the necessary and more accurate information can be obtained from the data gathered by wireless sensor networks with less number of samples. In this paper, we compare three types of data gathering technique.</p>";;;graduate-professional;engineering;curriculum-instruction;en;Compressive Sensor Network|Peas|Wireless Sensor Networks;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/in/;cc-by-nc-nd;;;Module;student|teacher;2017-10-24T05:26:51

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/15965/overview;Lesson 0: Getting Started;"<p>COURSE INTRODUCTION</p><p>Higher education is warming to the notion of providing access to free and low-cost open resources to support students and teachers with accessible learning objects, on-demand. This more open approach, although non-traditional, breaks down both inter- and intra- institutional silos and encourages collaboration between learners and teachers. It introduces diverse and multiple perspectives and promotes mutual respect for varying ideas.</p><p>In addition, a learner-centered approach increasingly characterizes higher education practice (Brown, Dehoney &amp; Millichap (2017). To meet the needs of millennial learners, instructors in higher education must evolve their teaching methodology to include social learning, interaction (learner-instructor, learner-learner and learner-content) personalization and universal design. In order to innovate current teaching practices, novel methods must be shared, demonstrated and reflected upon among collaborating educators. One way to transform teaching methodologies to improve outcomes among 21st century learners is professional development. The open educational environment is an ideal venue for facilitating this transformation in teaching philosophy and pedagogy.</p><p>To this end, Teaching Online 101 (TO 101) was developed as an open educational course available to anyone that desires to improve teaching and learning by examining their current practice, familiarizing themselves with learner-centric and interactive strategies and thus adapting their approach to 21st century learners in online and hybrid environments.</p>";;;graduate-professional;higher-education;professional-development;en;Learning About Learning|Online Activities|Teaching Activities;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/;cc-by-nc-sa;;;Module;student|teacher;2017-07-30T21:36:55

To help World Language Educators accomplish this, the Nebraska Department of Education invited experienced world language teachers across the state to create student-friendly assessments in the form of can-do statements in the summer of 2023.&nbsp;This document is a student-friendly self-assessment activity for Advanced Low world language learners created based on the 2019 Nebraska World Language Standards. The language use described in all can-do statements is meant for the target language, except for the second for standard 3.1 and the first for standard 4.2.&nbsp;It is recommended that world language teachers engage students with this document three times in an academic year: pre-course, mid-course, and post-course. Engaging students with this self-assessment activity will help students see growth over time and hopefully attribute growth to effective learning practices.

Different combinational approaches have been adopted by researchers such as the&nbsp;<br />use of tissue plasminogen activators, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and convalescent plasma therapy, intravenous&nbsp;<br />immunoglobulins, antivirals drugs, antimalarials, antibiotics, interleukin antagonists, and corticosteroids to combat COVID-19.&nbsp;<br />These therapies have corroborated to be constructive at some levels among individuals having a severe medical history as well as&nbsp;<br />individuals without any profound medical history</p>";;;graduate-professional;health-medicine-and-nursing;professional-development;en;Antiviral Roots|Coronavirus|COVID-19;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/;cc-by-nc-sa;;;Case Study;teacher;2020-07-15T09:17:14

To help World Language Educators accomplish this, the Nebraska Department of Education invited experienced world language teachers across the state to create student-friendly assessments in the form of can-do statements in the summer of 2024.&nbsp;This document is a student-friendly self-assessment activity for Advanced Low world language learners created based on the 2019 Nebraska World Language Standards. The language use described in all can-do statements is meant for the target language, except for the second for standard 3.1 and the first for standard 4.2.&nbsp;It is recommended that world language teachers engage students with this document three times in an academic year: pre-course, mid-course, and post-course. Engaging students with this self-assessment activity will help students see growth over time and hopefully attribute growth to effective learning practices.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/61828/overview;AER Newsletter: Summer 2019;"<p>Welcome to the first, biannual Archival Educators Roundtable (AER) Newsletter! In 2016, the Rockefeller Archive Center (RAC) brought together like-minded professionals who use primary sources for public programming, outreach, and education, and the AER was born. As archival education is a still-developing field, the AER created a community where people could share their successes, challenges, and works in progress through casual workshops.<br /><br />AER&rsquo;s network of educators, archivists, and archival education allies has since expanded its culture of support beyond the biannual meetings here at the RAC through social media, event attendance, joint publications, and email correspondence.<br /><br />It is our hope that this AER Newsletter will further extend the table, so speak, reaching more colleagues as we spotlight educators, and showcase the projects, challenges, and successes of archival education. Just as the aim of AER meetings is to ensure that all perspectives on primary source education are honored, we encourage you, our dedicated AER audience, to reach out and contribute your insights to future AER Newsletters!

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21423/overview;Structured Decision Making® and Child Welfare Service Delivery Project﻿;"<p>This curriculum examines the types of decisions child welfare workers are required to make, the factors that influence their decision-making patterns, and various approaches that could potentially improve decision making on both an individual and organizational level. To further explore the issues surrounding decision making, the curriculum focuses specifically on Structured Decision Making&reg; (SDM&reg;), a model that can be used to assist social workers in making accurate and consistent decisions about the levels of risk for maltreatment found in families, to provide guidance about service provision, and to assist with reunification and permanency planning. In 1999, the State of California decided to make SDM&reg; a required tool for child welfare agencies statewide, and SDM&reg; has since been implemented in several counties, including Los Angeles. To explore the implementation and effects of SDM&reg;<br />and its implications on child welfare decision making, the authors conducted a multi-level study in conjunction with the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services. The study addressed three central questions: (a) what are the challenges related to implementing the full SDM&reg; model in the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), (b) what impact does implementation of the full SDM&reg; model have on child welfare service delivery, and (c) what impact does implementation of the full SDM&reg; model have on child permanency outcomes?&nbsp;(254 pages)&nbsp;</p><p>Kim, A.

They were built and developed with Adobe Captivate 9 and published in HTML5 format, suitable for use with Moodle.</p><p>This set of exercises is designed to show students in the Arts &amp; Humanities how to take a research topic and turn it into a useful and relevant set of search terms they can then use in an academic database to retrieve and view journal articles. ProQuest&#39;s Humanities Index was used as the demonstration database.</p><p>The exercises cover three&nbsp;topics:</p><ol><li>Using effective search terms - the author describes the process by which you generate key concepts from a focussed research question in order to use them as search terms</li><li>Using databases - the author describes the advantages of using databases over other search resources, providing guidance both on how to find King&#39;s resources and how to use the search terms within them</li><li>Practice exercise - the students have the chance to recreate the steps laid out in the previous two exercises in a simulation space designed to familiarise them with the various interfaces being used.</li></ol><p>This section of KLaSS is comprised of two demonstration exercises, narrated by the author Jane Pothecary, and a practice exercise. The practice exercise is not narrated, but designed to act as a practice run for the student&nbsp;where they click the correct part of the screen to advance through the exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>The exercises have been published in HTML5 format so they should be compatible with any modern LMS.

To help World Language Educators accomplish this, the Nebraska Department of Education invited experienced world language teachers across the state to create student-friendly assessments in the form of can-do statements in the summer of 2023.&nbsp;This document is a student-friendly self-assessment activity for Advanced Low world language learners created based on the 2019 Nebraska World Language Standards. The language use described in all can-do statements is meant for the target language, except for the second for standard 3.1 and the first for standard 4.2.&nbsp;It is recommended that world language teachers engage students with this document three times in an academic year: pre-course, mid-course, and post-course. Engaging students with this self-assessment activity will help students see growth over time and hopefully attribute growth to effective learning practices.

Some are meant to be done individually, while others are designed for group dialogue and interaction. Dialogue in this case is used as way to build shared understanding. This is compared to discussion where a group is working on making a decision or choice. This difference is based upon the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.thinkingcollaborative.com/"">Adaptive School Work of Garmston and Wellman.</a>&nbsp;You can read more about this in Chapter 4 of the Adaptive School: A Sourcebook for Developing Collaborative Groups.&nbsp;</h2><h2>The design of the modules and overall framework is also informed by the research about professional development from A Facilitator&#39;s Guide to Online Professional Development: Establishing Communities of Learning and Cultures of Thinking by Carol Brooks Simoneau and Gerald Bailey.</h2><h2><strong>Instructor Descriptions</strong></h2><h2>Accompanying each task is a backend &quot;Instructor Description.&quot; Each Instructor Description is only intended for the instructor or facilitator of the module and not the educator participating as a learner in the module.

This has to be done very carefully, otherwise misleading conclusions may be drawn and the whole purpose of doing research may get vitiated.

Through interpretation the meanings and implications of the study become clear. Analysis is not complete without interpretation, and interpretation can not proceed without analysis. Both are, thus, inter-dependent.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/17686/overview;Nanomaterials;"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nanomaterials</strong></p><h3>Introduction</h3><p><strong>What are nanomaterials?</strong></p><p>Nanomaterials have unanimously settled on a precise definition given by Scientists. They are partially characterized by their small size in nanometers. &nbsp;One millionth of a millimeter approximately 100,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair is called nanometer.</p><p>From a variety of products nano-sized particles exist in nature and can be created, for instance, carbon or minerals like silver, but nanomaterials by definition must have at least one dimension less than approximately 100 nanometers. Most of the nanoscale materials are too small to be seen with the naked eye and even with conventional lab microscopes.</p><p>Upon converting the nanomaterials as engineered materials from a variety of products they have shown unique optical, magnetic, electrical, and other properties. These emergent properties have the potential for great impacts in electronics, medicine, and other fields. For example,</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nanotechnology is being used to design target oriented pharmaceuticals to target organs or cells in the body such as cancer cells, and enhance the effectiveness of therapy.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In cement, cloth and other materials to make them stronger and yet lighter the nanomaterials are being used.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of their small size they are extremely useful in electronics, and they can also be used in environmental remediation or clean-up to bind with and neutralize toxins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Engineered nanomaterials on the other hand have provided great benefits on human health and the environment. Even well-known materials, such as silver for example, may pose a hazard when engineered to nano size.</p><p>Fibrous nanomaterials made of carbon have been shown to induce inflammation in the lungs in ways that are similar to&nbsp;asbestos. Nano-sized particles can enter the human body through inhalation and ingestion and through the skin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Where are nanomaterials found?</strong></p><p>Nature has produced some nanomaterials, such as blood borne proteins essential for life and lipids found in the blood and body fat.&nbsp; Scientists, however, are particularly interested in engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), which are designed for use in many commercial materials, devices and structures. &nbsp;Already, thousands of common products-- including sunscreens, cosmetics, sporting goods, stain-resistant clothing, tires, and electronics&mdash;are manufactured using ENMs. They are also in medical diagnosis, imaging and drug delivery and in environmental remediation.</p><p><strong>Synthesis of nanomaterials</strong></p><p>Mainly there are two types:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Top-Down Approach</em>. Another way to think about this is &ldquo;making big stuff smaller.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Bottom-Up Approach</em>. &nbsp;Another way to think about this is &ldquo;making small stuff bigger.&rdquo;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Top-Down Approach</h3><p>By the top-down approach the&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://sustainable-nano.com/2013/05/23/kids-learn-about-nanodiamonds-and-i-learn-about-kids/"">nanodiamond</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;is made.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://sustainable-nano.com/2014/02/18/the-atomic-difference-between-diamonds-and-graphite/"">Nanodiamond is nearly pure carbon</a>.&nbsp; Nanodiamond is&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://sustainable-nano.com/2014/01/23/nuclear-proliferation-sustainability-the-history-of-nanodiamonds/"">made by detonation (explosion)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.hielscher.com/ultrasonic-synthesis-of-nanodiamonds.htm"">ultrasonication (using sound waves to break up materials) of bulk graphite flakes</a>: This method of synthesis converts millimeter-size flakes of graphite into nanoscale diamond particles.&nbsp; The process costs some energy and does not sound very controllable, but if all goes well, you will get nanodiamond particles that are about 5 nanometers in diameter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://hamers.chem.wisc.edu/"">Bob Hamers&rsquo; group</a>&nbsp;is working on ways to chemically modify nanodiamond particles so they will be stable in water for our biological experiments.</p><p><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shapetype id=""_x0000_t75""  coordsize=""21600,21600"" o:spt=""75"" o:preferrelative=""t"" path=""m@4@5l@4@11@9@11@9@5xe""  filled=""f"" stroked=""f"">  <v:stroke joinstyle=""miter""/>  <v:formulas>  <v:f eqn=""if lineDrawn pixelLineWidth 0""/>  <v:f eqn=""sum @0 1 0""/>  <v:f eqn=""sum 0 0 @1""/>  <v:f eqn=""prod @2 1 2""/>  <v:f eqn=""prod @3 21600 pixelWidth""/>  <v:f eqn=""prod @3 21600 pixelHeight""/>  <v:f eqn=""sum @0 0 1""/>  <v:f eqn=""prod @6 1 2""/>  <v:f eqn=""prod @7 21600 pixelWidth""/>  <v:f eqn=""sum @8 21600 0""/>  <v:f eqn=""prod @7 21600 pixelHeight""/>  <v:f eqn=""sum @10 21600 0""/>  </v:formulas>  <v:path o:extrusionok=""f"" gradientshapeok=""t"" o:connecttype=""rect""/>  <o:lock v:ext=""edit"" aspectratio=""t""/>  </v:shapetype><v:shape id=""Picture_x0020_6"" o:spid=""_x0000_i1025"" type=""#_x0000_t75""  alt=""https://sustainablenano.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/1-graphite-into-nanodiamonds.png""  style='width:226.5pt;height:114.75pt;visibility:visible'>  <v:imagedata src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image001.png""  o:title=""1-graphite-into-nanodiamonds""/>  </v:shape><![endif]--><img width=""302"" height=""153"" alt=""https://sustainablenano.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/1-graphite-into-nanodiamonds.png"" src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image002.gif"" /></p><h3>Bottom-Up Approach</h3><p>By a bottom-up approach, the gold nanoparticles&nbsp;are made.&nbsp; It uses water-soluble form of gold, known as a gold salt, HAuCl<sub>4</sub>.&nbsp; This gold salt produces H<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;and AuCl<sub>4</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>&nbsp;ions when dissolved in water.&nbsp; Later add a chemical compound called a reducing agent, which converts the gold ions into elemental gold atoms.

I have illustrated this below, and I am just showing 4 gold compounds to illustrate the chemistry: The problem here is that as those gold atoms form nano-sized lumps of gold, they have a tendency to continue to grow into bigger, non-nano-sized lumps.&nbsp; If we are not careful, we just form big flakes of gold:</p><p><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id=""Picture_x0020_9""  o:spid=""_x0000_i1026"" type=""#_x0000_t75"" alt=""https://sustainablenano.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/2-gold-nanoparticle-formation-diagram.png""  style='width:398.25pt;height:134.25pt;visibility:visible'>  <v:imagedata src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image003.png""  o:title=""2-gold-nanoparticle-formation-diagram""/>  </v:shape><![endif]--><img width=""531"" height=""179"" alt=""https://sustainablenano.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/2-gold-nanoparticle-formation-diagram.png"" src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image004.gif"" /></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Structure of nanomaterials</strong></p><p>Nanomaterials&nbsp;describe, in principle, materials of which a single unit is sized (in at least one dimension) between 1 to 1000 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"">nanometres</a>&nbsp;(10<sup>&minus;9</sup>&nbsp;meter) but usually is 1 to 100&nbsp;nm.</p><h2>Types of Nanomaterials</h2><p>For the purpose of this article, most current nanomaterials could be organized into four types:</p><p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carbon Based Materials</p><p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metal Based Materials</p><p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dendrimers</p><p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Composites</p><h2>Carbon Based Materials</h2><p>These nanomaterials are composed mostly of carbon, most commonly taking the form of a hollow spheres, ellipsoids, or tubes. Spherical and ellipsoidal carbon nanomaterials are referred to as fullerenes, while cylindrical ones are called nanotubes. These particles have many potential applications, including improved films and coatings, stronger and lighter materials, and applications in electronics.</p><h2>Metal Based Materials</h2><p>These nanomaterials include quantum dots, nanogold, nanosilver and metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide. A quantum dot is a closely packed semiconductor crystal comprised of hundreds or thousands of atoms, and whose size is on the order of a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers. Changing the size of quantum dots changes their optical properties.</p><h2>Dendrimers</h2><p>These nanomaterials are nanosized polymers built from branched units. The surface of a dendrimer has numerous chain ends, which can be tailored to perform specific chemical functions. This property could also be useful for catalysis. Also, because three-dimensional dendrimers contain interior cavities into which other molecules could be placed, they may be useful for drug delivery.</p><h2>Composites</h2><p>Composites combine nanoparticles with other nanoparticles or with larger, bulk-type materials. Nanoparticles, such as nanosized clays, are already being added to products ranging from auto parts to packaging materials, to enhance mechanical, thermal, barrier, and flame-retardant properties.</p><h2>Unique Properties</h2><p>The unique properties of these various types of intentionally produced nanomaterials give them novel electrical, catalytic, magnetic, mechanical, thermal, or imaging features that are highly desirable for applications in commercial, medical, military, and environmental sectors. These materials may also find their way into more complex nanostructures and systems. As new uses for materials with these special properties are identified, the number of products containing such nanomaterials and their possible applications continues to grow.</p><h2><strong>Types of Nanomaterials</strong></h2><p>There are mainly two types of nanomaterials. They are</p><ul><li>Fullerenes</li><li>Nanoparticles</li></ul><h3>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Fullerenes</strong></h3><p>Fullerenes are actually grapheme sheets rolled in the form of spheres and are actually a class of allotropes of carbon. A main example of fullerene is carbon nanotubes. They are known for their mechanical strength and their good electrical conductivity. Take a look at the fullerene structure given below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.circuitstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Fullerene-Structure.jpg""><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape  id=""_x0000_i1027"" type=""#_x0000_t75"" alt=""Fullerene Structure"" style='width:114.75pt;  height:114.75pt' o:button=""t"">  <v:imagedata src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image005.jpg""  o:href=""http://www.circuitstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Fullerene-Structure.jpg""/>  </v:shape><![endif]--><img width=""153"" height=""153"" alt=""Fullerene Structure"" src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image006.jpg"" /></a></p><p>Fullerene Structure</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/webprojects2002/mjames/c60b.jpg"">Image Source</a></p><p>Fullerenes are mainly used in the medical field as they are known for binding certain types of antibiotics to the structure of resistant bacteria. They are also found to be resistant against melanoma, at type of cancer cell. All these are possible only because of the good physical and chemical properties of fullerenes. They are also known for their high resistance and superconductivity properties. Thus, they also find great applications as light-activated antimicrobial agents.</p><p>Fullerenes are obtained by inserting a large amount of current in between two very close graphite electrodes in an atmosphere that is inert in nature.</p><p>From the reaction a carbon plasma arc is obtained in between the electrodes, which then forms as a residue. This residue is then converted to obtain fullerenes.</p><h3>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Nanoparticles</strong></h3><p>Nanoparticles are made from metals, semiconductors, and other particles that have great chemical, physical, electrical and magnetic properties. Nanoparticles find its main application as chemical catalysts.</p><p>Nanoparticles have a size so small, that they actually lie between the bulk materials and the molecular structures. &nbsp;As a result they possess some of the properties of the bulk materials as well as molecular structures.</p><p>To know the special properties of nanoparticles, let us compare the bending if bulk copper with that of copper nanoparticles. If bulk copper is bent, the movement of copper atoms/clusters is approximated to be at the 50 nm scale. At the same time, copper nanoparticles which have sizes below 60 nanometres will not have the same ductility like bulk copper. Also, when the size decreases, they are known to be very hard.</p><h3>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Sol-gel</strong></h3><p>Sol-gels are also considered as nanomaterials for some applications. It finds its main application in some fields like material science and ceramic engineering. The actual process for producing sol-gel is called Chemical Solution Deposition. Such a wet-chemical process is used mainly for the fabrication of metal oxide. Te process starts with a chemical solution, which acts like a precursor. The most common precursors used are metal alkoxides and metal chlorides. These precursors undergo severe reactions to produce a network called &ldquo;elastic solid&rdquo;. Such an elastic solid will be a complex system which includes amorphous submicrometer particles dispersed to various degrees in a host fluid.</p><h3><strong>Characteristics of Nanomaterials</strong></h3><p>The main characteristics of nanomaterials like size and shape were observed during the early 1900&rsquo;s. The main study was done by Zsigmondy, who made detailed studies of nanomaterials that were lesser than 10 nanometers in size.

They are partially characterized by their small size in nanometers. &nbsp;One millionth of a millimeter approximately 100,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair is called nanometer.</p><p>From a variety of products nano-sized particles exist in nature and can be created, for instance, carbon or minerals like silver, but nanomaterials by definition must have at least one dimension less than approximately 100 nanometers. Most of the nanoscale materials are too small to be seen with the naked eye and even with conventional lab microscopes.</p><p>Upon converting the nanomaterials as engineered materials from a variety of products they have shown unique optical, magnetic, electrical, and other properties. These emergent properties have the potential for great impacts in electronics, medicine, and other fields. For example,</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nanotechnology is being used to design target oriented pharmaceuticals to target organs or cells in the body such as cancer cells, and enhance the effectiveness of therapy.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In cement, cloth and other materials to make them stronger and yet lighter the nanomaterials are being used.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of their small size they are extremely useful in electronics, and they can also be used in environmental remediation or clean-up to bind with and neutralize toxins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Engineered nanomaterials on the other hand have provided great benefits on human health and the environment. Even well-known materials, such as silver for example, may pose a hazard when engineered to nano size.</p><p>Fibrous nanomaterials made of carbon have been shown to induce inflammation in the lungs in ways that are similar to&nbsp;asbestos. Nano-sized particles can enter the human body through inhalation and ingestion and through the skin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Where are nanomaterials found?</strong></p><p>Nature has produced some nanomaterials, such as blood borne proteins essential for life and lipids found in the blood and body fat.&nbsp; Scientists, however, are particularly interested in engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), which are designed for use in many commercial materials, devices and structures. &nbsp;Already, thousands of common products-- including sunscreens, cosmetics, sporting goods, stain-resistant clothing, tires, and electronics&mdash;are manufactured using ENMs. They are also in medical diagnosis, imaging and drug delivery and in environmental remediation.</p><p><strong>Synthesis of nanomaterials</strong></p><p>Mainly there are two types:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Top-Down Approach</em>.

Spherical and ellipsoidal carbon nanomaterials are referred to as fullerenes, while cylindrical ones are called nanotubes. These particles have many potential applications, including improved films and coatings, stronger and lighter materials, and applications in electronics.</p><h2>Metal Based Materials</h2><p>These nanomaterials include quantum dots, nanogold, nanosilver and metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide. A quantum dot is a closely packed semiconductor crystal comprised of hundreds or thousands of atoms, and whose size is on the order of a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers. Changing the size of quantum dots changes their optical properties.</p><h2>Dendrimers</h2><p>These nanomaterials are nanosized polymers built from branched units. The surface of a dendrimer has numerous chain ends, which can be tailored to perform specific chemical functions. This property could also be useful for catalysis. Also, because three-dimensional dendrimers contain interior cavities into which other molecules could be placed, they may be useful for drug delivery.</p><h2>Composites</h2><p>Composites combine nanoparticles with other nanoparticles or with larger, bulk-type materials. Nanoparticles, such as nanosized clays, are already being added to products ranging from auto parts to packaging materials, to enhance mechanical, thermal, barrier, and flame-retardant properties.</p><h2>Unique Properties</h2><p>The unique properties of these various types of intentionally produced nanomaterials give them novel electrical, catalytic, magnetic, mechanical, thermal, or imaging features that are highly desirable for applications in commercial, medical, military, and environmental sectors. These materials may also find their way into more complex nanostructures and systems. As new uses for materials with these special properties are identified, the number of products containing such nanomaterials and their possible applications continues to grow.</p><h2><strong>Types of Nanomaterials</strong></h2><p>There are mainly two types of nanomaterials. They are</p><ul><li>Fullerenes</li><li>Nanoparticles</li></ul><h3>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Fullerenes</strong></h3><p>Fullerenes are actually grapheme sheets rolled in the form of spheres and are actually a class of allotropes of carbon. A main example of fullerene is carbon nanotubes. They are known for their mechanical strength and their good electrical conductivity. Take a look at the fullerene structure given below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.circuitstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Fullerene-Structure.jpg""><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape  id=""_x0000_i1027"" type=""#_x0000_t75"" alt=""Fullerene Structure"" style='width:114.75pt;  height:114.75pt' o:button=""t"">  <v:imagedata src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image005.jpg""  o:href=""http://www.circuitstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Fullerene-Structure.jpg""/>  </v:shape><![endif]--><img width=""153"" height=""153"" alt=""Fullerene Structure"" src=""file:///C:\Users\KEERTHI\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image006.jpg"" /></a></p><p>Fullerene Structure</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/webprojects2002/mjames/c60b.jpg"">Image Source</a></p><p>Fullerenes are mainly used in the medical field as they are known for binding certain types of antibiotics to the structure of resistant bacteria. They are also found to be resistant against melanoma, at type of cancer cell. All these are possible only because of the good physical and chemical properties of fullerenes. They are also known for their high resistance and superconductivity properties. Thus, they also find great applications as light-activated antimicrobial agents.</p><p>Fullerenes are obtained by inserting a large amount of current in between two very close graphite electrodes in an atmosphere that is inert in nature.</p><p>From the reaction a carbon plasma arc is obtained in between the electrodes, which then forms as a residue. This residue is then converted to obtain fullerenes.</p><h3>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Nanoparticles</strong></h3><p>Nanoparticles are made from metals, semiconductors, and other particles that have great chemical, physical, electrical and magnetic properties. Nanoparticles find its main application as chemical catalysts.</p><p>Nanoparticles have a size so small, that they actually lie between the bulk materials and the molecular structures. &nbsp;As a result they possess some of the properties of the bulk materials as well as molecular structures.</p><p>To know the special properties of nanoparticles, let us compare the bending if bulk copper with that of copper nanoparticles. If bulk copper is bent, the movement of copper atoms/clusters is approximated to be at the 50 nm scale. At the same time, copper nanoparticles which have sizes below 60 nanometres will not have the same ductility like bulk copper. Also, when the size decreases, they are known to be very hard.</p><h3>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Sol-gel</strong></h3><p>Sol-gels are also considered as nanomaterials for some applications. It finds its main application in some fields like material science and ceramic engineering. The actual process for producing sol-gel is called Chemical Solution Deposition. Such a wet-chemical process is used mainly for the fabrication of metal oxide. Te process starts with a chemical solution, which acts like a precursor. The most common precursors used are metal alkoxides and metal chlorides. These precursors undergo severe reactions to produce a network called &ldquo;elastic solid&rdquo;. Such an elastic solid will be a complex system which includes amorphous submicrometer particles dispersed to various degrees in a host fluid.</p><h3><strong>Characteristics of Nanomaterials</strong></h3><p>The main characteristics of nanomaterials like size and shape were observed during the early 1900&rsquo;s. The main study was done by Zsigmondy, who made detailed studies of nanomaterials that were lesser than 10 nanometers in size. As most of these particles are much smaller than the wavelength of light, an ultramicroscope was used for seeing them.</p><p>Different types of techniques are employed to characterize the nanoparticles.

This module focuses on formative assessment and how it can help educators to make student thinking visible and also how to use student ideas and models for teaching in the NGSS classroom.&nbsp; It builds on the work of the first two: Module #1 Phenomena &amp; Equity, Module #2 Talk &amp; Equity.</h2><h2>All Oregon Science Project Hybrid NGSS PD Modules are designed to be done together with other educators in real time either online or face-to-face. The Oregon Science Project utilizes the videoconferencing tools of Zoom to run small teams of K-12 educators through these modules online in real time. Some Oregon Science Project Learning Facilitators are able to meet with their teams in person and still use these modules on computers during face-to-face work.</h2><h2>It was built using the OER Commons Module builder so it is broken into units as Tasks. Some are meant to be done individually, while others are designed for group dialogue and interaction. Dialogue in this case is used as way to build shared understanding. This is compared to discussion where a group is working on making a decision or choice. This difference is based upon the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.thinkingcollaborative.com/"">Adaptive School Work of Garmston and Wellman.</a>&nbsp;You can read more about this in Chapter 4 of the Adaptive School: A Sourcebook for Developing Collaborative Groups.&nbsp;</h2><h2>The design of the modules and overall framework is also informed by the research about professional development from A Facilitator&#39;s Guide to Online Professional Development: Establishing Communities of Learning and Cultures of Thinking by Carol Brooks Simoneau and Gerald Bailey.</h2><h2><strong>Instructor Descriptions</strong></h2><h2>Accompanying each task is a backend &quot;Instructor Description.&quot; Each Instructor Description is only intended for the instructor or facilitator of the module and not the educator participating as a learner in the module.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/101759/overview;Biostatistics: Data and Models;"<p>This textbook provides a survey of statistical methods commonly used in the life sciences, an introduction to statistical theory, and significant exposure to the statistical software package SAS 9.4. The textbook is designed for graduate students and upper division undergraduates, and assumes some familiarity with mathematical notation, functions, and algebra. No previous courses in statistics are needed. For those interested in using the software package R, programs similar in function to the SAS ones are also provided. A unique feature of this textbook is the integration of statistical procedures and theory. Most introductory texts present the statistical procedures and a mechanistic explanation of how they work, without discussing the underlying theory. Some knowledge of this theory is essential for students in the life sciences, especially graduate students, and so the textbook uses likelihood theory to explain how parameters are estimated and statistical tests derived. The statistical models for ANOVA, regression, and other common procedures are also presented. These theoretical concepts are presented in both equation and graphical form.&nbsp;For detailed information on the topics covered in this textbook, see the Table of Contents file in Section 1.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>";;;college-upper-division|graduate-professional;life-science|ecology|forestry-and-agriculture|statistics-and-probability;;en;;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/;cc-by;;;Textbook;;2023-03-10T16:08:44

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21430/overview;Pathways to Collaboration: Understanding the Role of Values and System-Related Factors in Collaboration Between Child Welfare and Substance Abuse Treatment Fields﻿;"<p>Research over the last 20 years has documented a strong correlation between substance abuse and risk of involvement in the child welfare system. More recently, a growing body of research and policy analysis focused on addressing the needs of substance-abusing families in child welfare calls for &ldquo;bridging the gap&rdquo; in values and attitudes between child welfare and substance abuse treatment service delivery systems and developing collaborative models for intervention and case planning. This research-based curriculum increases awareness about how individual and professional values may impact interdisciplinary practice and is designed to develop skills for improved collaborative practice among child welfare workers, substance abuse treatment professionals, and other professionals working with substance abusing families involved in the child welfare system. This study examined similarities and differences in values and perceived capacity for collaboration between substance abuse and child welfare fields based on survey data from respondents in counties in California. The instruments used in this study, the Collaborative Values Inventory (CVI) and Collaborative Capacity Instrument (CCI), were developed by Children and Family Futures/National Center for Substance Abuse and Child Welfare.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21294/overview;Family Reunification Among Mexican and Vietnamese Immigrant Children in the Child Welfare System: Toward an Understanding of Promising Practices to Improve Service Availability and Effectiveness.;"<p>National, state, or local-level data are limited with respect to the characteristics of immigrant children in the child welfare system, the proportion of immigrant children who reunify, or the constellation of services that may be associated with family reunification among immigrant families. To fill these gaps in the literature, practice, and policy, this project examined family reunification among Mexican and Vietnamese immigrant and non-immigrant children and identified promising practices to improve service availability and effectiveness. This study used quantitative and qualitative methods and was conducted in two counties in Northern California. This curriculum has five overall goals: (a) to understand common characteristics among Mexican and Vietnamese immigrant families in the U.S. and California and connections among parenting and acculturation; (b) to understand distinctive characteristics of Mexican and Vietnamese immigrants in the child welfare system, compared to non-immigrants; (c) to understand factors that contribute to reunification among Mexican and Vietnamese immigrant families involved in family reunification services; (d) to understand how the work of a child welfare worker influences service availability for Mexican and Vietnamese immigrant families; and (e) to understand the basic components of cultural competence and how these relate to service effectiveness with immigrant families involved in the child welfare system.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21293/overview;Using Publicly Available Data to Engage IV-E Students in Research and Statistics: Instructional Modules.;"<p>Increasingly, public agencies are adopting models of self-assessment in which administrative data are used to guide and then continuously evaluate the implementation of programs and policies. In California, public child welfare agencies track performance outcomes spanning a range of child safety, permanency, and well-being domains, as dictated by federal and state mandates. This curriculum has been designed to provide Title IV-E and others students interested in public child welfare systems with an overview of the state&rsquo;s Child Welfare Outcomes and Accountability System. Students will be provided with hands-on opportunities to become experienced and &ldquo;statistically literate&rdquo; users of aggregate, public child welfare data from the state&rsquo;s administrative child welfare system, attending to the often missing link between data/research and practice. This curriculum is organized into five teaching modules, providing instructors with student learning activities, PowerPoint slide presentations, and other materials to support graduate IV-E students in the development of practical data analysis skills. Materials focus on publicly available data hosted through the Child Welfare Indicators Project at the University of California at Berkeley, a long-standing agency/university data partnership:&nbsp;<a href=""http://cssr.berkeley.edu/ucb_childwelfare"">http://cssr.berkeley.edu/ucb_childwelfare</a>. CalSWEC funding for the development of this curriculum was provided to the Child Welfare Performance Indicators Project. Modules were developed to support instructors of both first- and second-year MSW research courses. Module objectives include: (a) to support student (and instructor) understanding of California&#39;s child welfare system performance goals and progress to date; (b) to develop students who have highly desirable (and practical) data analysis skills, including the ability to intelligibly distill and present numerical findings; and (c) to prepare a cohort of IV-E MSW students equipped to adopt leadership roles in county child welfare agencies, bringing with them an appreciation for how data can be used to improve practice and inform policies.&nbsp;</p><p>Putnam-Hornstein, E., Needell, B., Lery, B., King, B., &amp; Weigmann, W.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21451/overview;Development of Competencies for the California Public Child Welfare Curriculum Through Evaluation and Partnership﻿;"<p>This report covers the development and uses of competencies, the programmatic foundation of CalSWEC&#39;s child welfare services effort for public child welfare graduate social work education. Competencies are developed to create a foundation of principles, goals, and learning objectives for public child welfare MSW students and outline what graduate social work specialists in child welfare need to know and be able to do in order to provide professional services to disadvantaged families and children. Part I describes the collaborative methods used to develop the competencies. Part II lists the actual competencies. Each competency includes an objective, a recommendation for the setting where the competency can best be learned (field/classroom), associated activities for use in the classroom and field, and suggested methods of student evaluation. Competencies have been used to: enhance collaboration between MSW programs and public agencies by providing a set of learning objectives for field placement contracts and a means for student evaluation, apply classroom learning to field practice, develop empirically-based curriculum, and develop curriculum for continuing education of public child welfare workers.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/10438/overview;Threshold Concepts: Reenvisioning K-12 Information Literacy Instruction;"<p>The idea of Threshold Concepts has been widely discussed in higher education for more than a decade. As defined by Jan H.F. Meyer and Ray Land, a threshold concept &ldquo;can be considered as akin to a portal, opening up a new and previously inaccessible way of thinking about something. It represents a transformed way of understanding, or interpreting, or viewing something without which the learner cannot progress&rdquo;. &nbsp;<a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.476.3389&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]"">(Meyer, J., &amp; Land, R. (2003).</a> Put another way, threshold concepts are the core ideas and principles in any discipline that often become second nature to experts, but may be completely foreign to the novice. And yet, without an understanding of these core concepts, learners cannot progress in further learning in any given subject area. As with all academic disciplines, threshold concepts exist in the area of Information Literacy; grasping information literacy threshold concepts is essential for students to become effective researchers.</p><p>In 2015, the American Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) replaced their Information Literacy Competency Standards, with a &ldquo;<a href=""http://www.ala.org/acrl/sites/ala.org.acrl/files/content/issues/infolit/Framework_ILHE.pdf"">Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education</a>&rdquo;. The Framework is organized into six Frames, each anchored by an information literacy threshold concept and supported by a set of knowledge practices and dispositions. These six information literacy threshold concepts include:</p><ul><li><p>Authority is Constructed and Contextual</p></li><li><p>Information Creation is a Process</p></li><li><p>Information Has Value</p></li><li><p>Research as Inquiry</p></li><li><p>Scholarship as Conversation</p></li><li><p>Searching as Strategic Exploration</p></li></ul><p>Based on the research studies and experiences of academic instruction librarians who see first-hand the challenges students experience when conducting college-level research, the new Framework was developed to support information literacy instruction in the digital age. The literature suggests that most students entering college are unprepared for the rigors of academic research. <a href=""http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED548262.pdf"">(Head, A. J. (2013)</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>If students can gain an understanding of these six threshold concepts, they will likely be better researchers and generally more successful in their academic work.<br /><br />What are the implications of this huge paradigm shift in college-level research instruction for school librarians? Simply put, school librarians have a wonderful opportunity to prepare students for college level research by systematically teaching information literacy threshold concepts in grades K-12. A scaffolded information literacy instruction program focused on threshold concepts along with standards and skills could help pave the way for students to be effective college researchers. With an estimated 30% of US college and university students dropping out after their first year, preparing research savvy students for the demands of college assignments could have a significant impact on student success and ultimately on college graduation rates. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Instructional&nbsp;Objectives</strong></p><ul><li>By the completion of Module 1, students will be able to identify a threshold concept from their field or discipline and design a learning activity that could be used to teach this concept.</li><li>By the completion of Module 2, students will be able to identify one or more stumbling blocks that students encounter when conducting academic research, and describe how a better grasp of one of the six ACRL Information Literacy threshold concepts could help overcome this research barrier.</li><li>By the completion of Module 3, students will be able to create a lesson plan for a K-12 classroom which teaches or reinforces the threshold concept &ldquo;Research as Inquiry&rdquo;.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>";;"<p>This module is divided into three sub-modules.

This difference is based upon the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.thinkingcollaborative.com/"">Adaptive School Work of Garmston and Wellman.</a>&nbsp;You can read more about this in Chapter 4 of the Adaptive School: A Sourcebook for Developing Collaborative Groups.&nbsp;</h2><h2>The design of the modules and overall framework is also informed by the research about professional development from A Facilitator&#39;s Guide to Online Professional Development: Establishing Communities of Learning and Cultures of Thinking by Carol Brooks Simoneau and Gerald Bailey.</h2><h2><strong>Instructor Descriptions</strong></h2><h2>Accompanying each task is a backend &quot;Instructor Description.&quot; Each Instructor Description is only intended for the instructor or facilitator of the module and not the educator participating as a learner in the module.

Many people ask, &ldquo;How did gender identities (beyond the binary gender system) and lovealities/sexualities (beyond the romantic love/sex between a male and a female) become twisted together to form one community?&quot; Dr. Walker-Roberts to provide their insight on the question by covering the following topics: LGBTQIAA+ key identity terms, a brief history of two events that forced the identities to form a community, and gender identity and lovealities/sexuality terminology. A comprehensive review of each identity strand is provided independently from each other. A re-imaged conversational flow is presented so people can avoid the unproductive apologetic cycle when incorrect assumptions are made regarding the two ways in which people identify. When people face new ideas, skills, concepts, and beliefs, they must accept using the growth heartset theory before relying on the growth mindset theory. The growth mindset theory is well-known, whereas the growth heartset theory is new. An explanation of the characteristics of the growth heartset theory is explained in this OER educational white paper.</p>";;;community-college-lower-division|college-upper-division|graduate-professional;gender-and-sexuality-studies;;en;;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/;cc-by-nc;;;Reading;;2024-07-16T10:19:18

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/110110/overview;Exploring the Future of Learning: Reflections on Sugata Mitra's Revolutionary Ideas;"<p>Reflecting on Sugata Mitra&#39;s talk, I appreciate his innovative approach towards education, especially his emphasis on self-directed learning and the effective use of technology. His experiments, like the &#39;Hole in the Wall,&#39; reveal surprising insights into the natural learning abilities of children. However, I find the complete reliance on technology and self-learning challenging, as it seems to overlook the nuanced needs of different learners and the invaluable role of teachers in guiding and mentoring students. In a classroom, Mitra&rsquo;s ideas could inspire the integration of technology to enhance student-led exploration and collaboration, fostering an environment where students are more active participants in their learning journey. This talk shifts the perception of teaching, suggesting a move away from traditional didactic methods towards a role where teachers act more as facilitators of learning, guiding and encouraging students to explore and learn autonomously.</p>";;;graduate-professional;technology;;en;;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/;cc-by;;;Assessment;;2023-11-12T19:05:52
https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/92633/overview;STEM Storytellers Syllabus;<p><span>Graduate education in the sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) rigorously prepares students to innovate in their fields, yet it often does not include formal training in how to effectively communicate those innovations to others. To ensure we live in a just and vibrant society, it is vital that scientists are able to share their research findings with scientists in other fields, non-science experts, and the public. Using knowledge from the performing arts, this course will implement a novel pilot training program to teach oral communication to STEM graduate students, facilitating a deeper understanding of communication and providing practice in public speaking, improvisational techniques, and reading body language. Three recruited cohorts of STEM graduate students used this course to practice and refine their oral communication skills by creating podcasts and speaking at community events in which they explain their research to the public.

The language use described in all can-do statements is meant for the target language, except for the second for standard 3.1 and the first for standard 4.2.&nbsp;It is recommended that world language teachers engage students with this document three times in an academic year: pre-course, mid-course, and post-course. Engaging students with this self-assessment activity will help students see growth over time and hopefully attribute growth to effective learning practices.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/10522/overview;Instructional Leadership - Learner variability;"<p>Knowledge of learners and learning is an essential priority for Library Media Specialists. As the demand for meeting the needs of all learners increases, LMSs are uniquely positioned to observe and support learners across the range of their strengths and challenges. Not only are they able to provide a variety of resources for gathering, processing, and producing information, LMSs are often&nbsp;afforded&nbsp;the opportunity to observe learner strengths that may go overlooked in classroom settings.</p><p>Personalizing learning is a shift from facilitating implementation of a curricular program to developing a repertoire of instructional resources and strategies to support learner variability. In bridging the&nbsp;disciplines of&nbsp;information and learning, the LMS stays abreast of developments in each, curating and accessing exceptional OER materials and&nbsp;integrating evidence-based mind, brain, and education science (MBES).&nbsp;</p><p>This module will take a look at the concept and science of learner variability, and investigate and apply two models for designing&nbsp;instruction&nbsp;for learner variability. Students are asked to build on their knowledge of Guided Inquiry Process (see Resources) and OER materials to leveraging learner profiles for effective instructional design.</p><p>This unit specifically addresses NH ED 614.11.A.1.a and 614.11.A.1.b.</p>";;"<p>In preparation for this module, the instructor is encouraged to set up a &quot;Facility&quot; in the Learner Sketch Tool (LST), and give participants the Facility name to connect to when taking the LST. &nbsp;This will allow the instructor to view aggregate results from students&#39; self-reports. The instructor will then be able to share the anonymous aggregate results, either in real time or through a screen shot, and demonstrate access to teaching strategies.</p><p>The Instructor is encouraged to watch The Myth of Average TedX talk in advance, to prepare questions for discussion prompts and/or to push students&#39; thinking about applications within and implications for the library media program.&nbsp;</p><p>UDL materials should be previewed, particularly the Rose/Meyer white paper, in order to facilitate online discussion of the ways LMSs can support quality learning for every student.</p>";graduate-professional;information-science;professional-development;en;Learner Variability|Personalization|Udl;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/;cc-by-nc-sa;;;Module;student|teacher;2016-09-12T16:53:07

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21426/overview;Mental Health Service Utilization and Outcomes for Children and Youth in the Child Welfare System: An Empirically Based Curriculum﻿;"<p>This curriculum focuses on issues related to mental health service utilization and outcomes among children in the child welfare system. In spite of the documented need for mental health services for these children, there is a lack of information on children involved with both the child welfare and mental health systems. In order to improve our understanding of the issues and needs of this population, this curriculum focuses on five areas: (a) demographic and system-related characteristics of children involved in both the child welfare and mental health systems; (b) clinical need for services, service utilization patterns, and association between mental health service utilization and child welfare outcomes; (c) policies affecting mental health service utilization by children in the child welfare system; (d) collaboration between child welfare and mental health systems; and (e) resources for collaboration and service provision for children and youth in both the child welfare and mental health systems. The curriculum will provide research highlights, conceptual frameworks, tools, and experiential opportunities to strengthen understanding of a wide range of issues related to mental health service utilization among children in the public child welfare system.

The presentations cover the foundational elements of education that bring most learners to the doctoral level of academic effort. We address the key skills of linking and aligning learning, decision-making, and accepting the gift of feedback. We review the danger of applying logical fallacies, identifying a problem, and narrowing the score of research for success. We cover the principles of time management and logical organization of reviewed literature. We examine how conducting a personal SWOT analysis can help doctoral students focus on research within their respective domains toward developing a solutions mindset. Finally, we address the need for full ownership and stewardship of the doctoral student as the agent of their own educational success.</p>;;;graduate-professional;higher-education;;en;;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/;cc-by-nc;;;Lecture;;2024-02-12T14:26:10

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21437/overview;Pathways to College: Understanding the Psychosocial and System-Related Factors That Contribute to College Enrollment and Attendance Among Emancipated Foster Youth: An Empirically Based Curriculum﻿;"<p>This curriculum, written for graduate social work students and child welfare workers, is designed to improve the quality of care and services provided to children in out-of-home care. It highlights the importance of providing child welfare services that are responsive to the needs of children who must prepare for emancipation and the responsibilities of adult life. While more research efforts are aimed at tracking youth emancipating from the foster care system, little is known about those who are currently enrolled in post-secondary education. Further, research on youth exiting the foster care system tends to highlight negative outcomes. Little is known of former foster youth who go on to lead healthy and productive lives and what the contributing factors were that enabled them to succeed. Understanding their pathways to college and identifying the factors related to educational achievement can help inform program and service delivery to youth currently in the foster care system.

Pressure exerted at the wall of the container is the average force per unit area due to the collision of the gas molecules on the wall surface. To determine this pressure, we need not know the behaviour of individual molecules of the gas. This approach is macroscropic approach. However, the results obtained from macroscopic and statistical study of matter.</p><p><strong>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thermodynamic Systems and Surroundings</strong></p><p>A Thermodynamic system is defined as a quantity of matter or a region in space whose behaviour is being investigated.</p><p>Everything external to the system is defined as surroundings.&nbsp; In its usual context the term &lsquo;surroundings&rsquo; is restricted to the regions in the immediate vicinity which has a detectable influence on the system.</p><p>Boundary is the surface which separates the system from its surroundings.&nbsp; It may be fixed or moving and real or imaginary.</p>";graduate-professional;engineering;curriculum-instruction;en;Thermodynamics;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/in/;cc-by-nc;;;Module;student|teacher;2016-09-23T00:55:43

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/102357/overview;Developing microbiological learning materials for schools: best practice;"<p>Microbiology is the study of microorganisms, which are tiny organisms that can only be seen with a microscope. Microorganisms include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Microorganisms are found everywhere in the environment, including in water, soil, air, and in the bodies of plants and animals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Microbiology is an important science that helps us to understand how microorganisms interact with each other and with their environment. Microbiology also helps us to understand how microorganisms can cause disease and how they can be used to produce food and medicines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Teaching microbiology can be a fun and interesting experience for students. There are many different ways to teach microbiology, and the best way to teach it will depend on the students&rsquo; age and level of education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One way to teach microbiology is to use learning materials that are specifically designed for schools. These materials can help to make the learning process more fun and interesting for students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the best practices for developing microbiology learning materials for schools include:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Developing materials that are age-appropriate</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Using fun and interactive activities</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Incorporating images and videos</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/82152/overview;E-Learning Process;<p>In comparison with e-learning content, e-learning processes evolve over time, and are essentially performed in such as way that they structure human activity using designs such as schedules, rules and protocols. Common e-learning activities include participating in online discussion, chat and other forms of conferencing (Salmon 2000), accessing specific e-learning content, taking tests and assessments, working through short exercises to stimulate thinking (Salmon 2002), or completing web forms such as those used in e-portfolios or course evaluation. While some elearning activities are direct analogues of offline activities, the majority (such as asynchronous communication) are significantly transformed by being in the online domain, and others, (such as interactive simulations and animation) are difficult to provide in any context other than an online environment.</p>;;;graduate-professional;health-medicine-and-nursing;;en;;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/;cc-by;;;Reading;;2021-06-09T07:22:08

However, the IEP team is the best expert on their student. It is best practice for the IEP to conduct an AT assessment on their students, with each team member contributing in the area of the assessment that aligns with their expertise.&nbsp; In this module, we will share the steps necessary for an assistive technology assessment, as well as resources and tools that will help the IEP team make data-informed decisions.&nbsp; Assessment ideas for common types of assistive technology tools will be discussed, such as tools for reading, writing, and math.&nbsp; In addition, resources will be shared for AT assessments that involve AT for vision, hearing, motor, and communication.&nbsp; We will also share WA State support agencies who exist to guide IEP teams during the AT assessment process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";;;adult-education;early-childhood-development|special-education;professional-development;en;Accessibility|Assistive Technology|Assistive Technology Assessment|At for Reading|At for Writing|Technology;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/;cc-by-nc-sa;;;Module;teacher|parent;2023-03-03T21:12:07

It is difficult to inherit the national cultural heritage and hand it down to descendants through individual efforts alone. We all need to take care of it and preserve it.<br /><br />As with arts that have been handed down by the people, there are no written records related to the genealogy of Subak and Subak Dance.<br /><br />However, it is possible to look into the context after the late Joseon Dynasty.<br /><br />Song Chang-yeol wanted to become a movie star in his youth, and it is said that he stayed for a while in a place called &lsquo;Shin-Film&rsquo;, which was directed by Shin Sang-ok.<br /><br />It seems that he is a former movie star, as he has appeared in several films, including a minor role in the movie &ldquo;The Martyr&rdquo; directed by Yoo Hyeon-mok. This person&#39;s maternal uncle is director Choi Hyun-min, who planned a movie called &#39;Sorrow in the Sky&#39;, which turned half of the Korean peninsula into a sea of tears in 1965.<br /><br />Song Chang-ryeol was born in February 1932 in Bukcheong-gun, Hamgyeongnam-do. In 1938, his father ran the &#39;Ohara Sewing Association&#39; in Osaka, Japan. From 1938 to 40 he lived in Osaka.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/56407/overview;Our Doors Are Open - Welcoming People with Disabilities  at Places of Worship;"<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""color:#1c1e29"">About&nbsp;15% of the world&rsquo;s population lives with some form of disability. &nbsp;Many are not having their needs met because of barriers to participation in rituals, worship and faith community activities at their places of worship. To truly empower people with disabilities to become agents of positive change in their local communities, we recognize that everyone has a role to play. Our Doors Are Open seminar helps all faith communities to understand how to open their mind, hearts, and doors to people with all kinds of abilities. Traditionally, faith communities position people with disabilities as recipients of care and not as givers. Most faith communities do not have proper representation of people with disabilities throughout their activities despite a desire to be open and inclusive. This disparity is often the result of lack of understanding of how to think about disability differently. In this seminar, students will learn the social model of disability, which positions disability as a function of exclusively designed environments rather than a lack of ability. Our Doors Are Open Seminar will guide students on how to see their activities and situations through an inclusive lens as well as how to take actions to improve inclusion and achieve the welcoming goals of congregations.</span></span></span></p>";;;adult-education;religious-studies;informal-education;en;Accessibility|Community Engagement|Diversity and Inclusion|Faith-Based Organizations|Inclusion|Inclusive Design|Worship;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/;cc-by-sa;;;Module;student|teacher;2019-07-24T09:23:20

To help World Language Educators accomplish this, the Nebraska Department of Education invited experienced world language teachers across the state to create student-friendly assessments in the form of can-do statements in the summer of 2023.&nbsp;This document is a student-friendly self-assessment activity for Advanced Low world language learners created based on the 2019 Nebraska World Language Standards. The language use described in all can-do statements is meant for the target language, except for the second for standard 3.1 and the first for standard 4.2.&nbsp;It is recommended that world language teachers engage students with this document three times in an academic year: pre-course, mid-course, and post-course. Engaging students with this self-assessment activity will help students see growth over time and hopefully attribute growth to effective learning practices.

Some are meant to be done individually, while others are designed for group dialogue and interaction. Dialogue in this case is used as way to build shared understanding.

This difference is based upon the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.thinkingcollaborative.com/"">Adaptive School Work of Garmston and Wellman.</a>&nbsp;You can read more about this in Chapter 4 of the Adaptive School: A Sourcebook for Developing Collaborative Groups.&nbsp;</h2><h2>The design of the modules and overall framework is also informed by the research about professional development from A Facilitator&#39;s Guide to Online Professional Development: Establishing Communities of Learning and Cultures of Thinking by Carol Brooks Simoneau and Gerald Bailey.</h2><h2><strong>Instructor Descriptions</strong></h2><h2>Accompanying each task is a backend &quot;Instructor Description.&quot; Each Instructor Description is only intended for the instructor or facilitator of the module and not the educator participating as a learner in the module.

The door magnets help the door stay unlatched, while making the door easy to lock in an emergency. Because the doors only lock and unlock with a key from the outside, exiting the classroom to lock the door with a key could be potentially dangerous in certain situations. This item includes two video tutorials on how to use the magnet. A flyer shows teachers when they should remove the magnet. Printed copies of this flyer would be placed in each teacher&#39;s mailbox after the training so they could hang it next to their door as a reminder of when they should remove the magnet. At the end of the lesson the learners will be able to place and quickly remove the magnet.

Some are meant to be done individually, while others are designed for group dialogue and interaction. Dialogue in this case is used as way to build shared understanding.

This difference is based upon the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.thinkingcollaborative.com/"">Adaptive School Work of Garmston and Wellman.</a>&nbsp;You can read more about this in Chapter 4 of the Adaptive School: A Sourcebook for Developing Collaborative Groups.&nbsp;</h2><h2>The design of the modules and overall framework is also informed by the research about professional development from A Facilitator&#39;s Guide to Online Professional Development: Establishing Communities of Learning and Cultures of Thinking by Carol Brooks Simoneau and Gerald Bailey.</h2><h2><strong>Instructor Descriptions</strong></h2><h2>Accompanying each task is a backend &quot;Instructor Description.&quot; Each Instructor Description is only intended for the instructor or facilitator of the module and not the educator participating as a learner in the module.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/108684/overview;Compassionate Integrity Training Manual;"<p>Compassionate Integrity Training (CIT) is a multi-part training program that cultivates basic human values as skills for the purpose of increasing individual, social, and environmental flourishing. By covering a range of skills from self-regulation and self-compassion to compassion for others and engagement with complex systems, CIT focuses on and builds toward compassionate integrity: the ability to live one&rsquo;s life in accordance with one&rsquo;s values with a recognition of common humanity, our basic orientation to kindness, and reciprocity. Unlike some definitions of integrity that focus on mere consistency with one&rsquo;s values, without examining what those values are, compassionate integrity insists that consistency with one&rsquo;s values is not enough if those values promote harm to oneself, others, or the world. Instead, maintaining and increasing consistency with one&rsquo;s values is most beneficial when they are values that promote one&rsquo;s own well-being as well as that of others. As to what those values are and how we understand them, this is arrived at by investigating and examining things for oneself, using common sense, shared experience, and science.</p><p dir=""ltr"">&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">&nbsp;</p><p><br />&nbsp;</p>";;;high-school|community-college-lower-division|college-upper-division|graduate-professional|adult-education;education;;en;Common Humanity|Compassion and Empathy|Integrity and Ethics|Interdependence|Peacebuilding|Systems Thinking|Trauma-informed Care;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/;cc-by;;;Reading;student|teacher|administrator|parent|librarian|other;2023-09-19T12:27:56 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Student Guide;;

This module focuses on formative assessment and how it can help educators to make student thinking visible and also how to use student ideas and models for teaching in the NGSS classroom.&nbsp; It builds on the work of the first two: Module #1 Phenomena &amp; Equity, Module #2 Talk &amp; Equity.</h2><h2>All Oregon Science Project Hybrid NGSS PD Modules are designed to be done together with other educators in real time either online or face-to-face. The Oregon Science Project utilizes the videoconferencing tools of Zoom to run small teams of K-12 educators through these modules online in real time. Some Oregon Science Project Learning Facilitators are able to meet with their teams in person and still use these modules on computers during face-to-face work.</h2><h2>It was built using the OER Commons Module builder so it is broken into units as Tasks. Some are meant to be done individually, while others are designed for group dialogue and interaction. Dialogue in this case is used as way to build shared understanding. This is compared to discussion where a group is working on making a decision or choice. This difference is based upon the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.thinkingcollaborative.com/"">Adaptive School Work of Garmston and Wellman.</a>&nbsp;You can read more about this in Chapter 4 of the Adaptive School: A Sourcebook for Developing Collaborative Groups.&nbsp;</h2><h2>The design of the modules and overall framework is also informed by the research about professional development from A Facilitator&#39;s Guide to Online Professional Development: Establishing Communities of Learning and Cultures of Thinking by Carol Brooks Simoneau and Gerald Bailey.</h2><h2><strong>Instructor Descriptions</strong></h2><h2>Accompanying each task is a backend &quot;Instructor Description.&quot; Each Instructor Description is only intended for the instructor or facilitator of the module and not the educator participating as a learner in the module.

This module focuses on formative assessment and how it can help educators to make student thinking visible and also how to use student ideas and models for teaching in the NGSS classroom.&nbsp; It builds on the work of the first two: Module #1 Phenomena &amp; Equity, Module #2 Talk &amp; Equity.</h2><h2>All Oregon Science Project Hybrid NGSS PD Modules are designed to be done together with other educators in real time either online or face-to-face. The Oregon Science Project utilizes the videoconferencing tools of Zoom to run small teams of K-12 educators through these modules online in real time. Some Oregon Science Project Learning Facilitators are able to meet with their teams in person and still use these modules on computers during face-to-face work.</h2><h2>It was built using the OER Commons Module builder so it is broken into units as Tasks. Some are meant to be done individually, while others are designed for group dialogue and interaction. Dialogue in this case is used as way to build shared understanding. This is compared to discussion where a group is working on making a decision or choice. This difference is based upon the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.thinkingcollaborative.com/"">Adaptive School Work of Garmston and Wellman.</a>&nbsp;You can read more about this in Chapter 4 of the Adaptive School: A Sourcebook for Developing Collaborative Groups.&nbsp;</h2><h2>The design of the modules and overall framework is also informed by the research about professional development from A Facilitator&#39;s Guide to Online Professional Development: Establishing Communities of Learning and Cultures of Thinking by Carol Brooks Simoneau and Gerald Bailey.</h2><h2><strong>Instructor Descriptions</strong></h2><h2>Accompanying each task is a backend &quot;Instructor Description.&quot; Each Instructor Description is only intended for the instructor or facilitator of the module and not the educator participating as a learner in the module.

This module focuses on formative assessment and how it can help educators to make student thinking visible and also how to use student ideas and models for teaching in the NGSS classroom.&nbsp; It builds on the work of the first two: Module #1 Phenomena &amp; Equity, Module #2 Talk &amp; Equity.</h2><h2>All Oregon Science Project Hybrid NGSS PD Modules are designed to be done together with other educators in real time either online or face-to-face. The Oregon Science Project utilizes the videoconferencing tools of Zoom to run small teams of K-12 educators through these modules online in real time. Some Oregon Science Project Learning Facilitators are able to meet with their teams in person and still use these modules on computers during face-to-face work.</h2><h2>It was built using the OER Commons Module builder so it is broken into units as Tasks. Some are meant to be done individually, while others are designed for group dialogue and interaction. Dialogue in this case is used as way to build shared understanding. This is compared to discussion where a group is working on making a decision or choice. This difference is based upon the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.thinkingcollaborative.com/"">Adaptive School Work of Garmston and Wellman.</a>&nbsp;You can read more about this in Chapter 4 of the Adaptive School: A Sourcebook for Developing Collaborative Groups.&nbsp;</h2><h2>The design of the modules and overall framework is also informed by the research about professional development from A Facilitator&#39;s Guide to Online Professional Development: Establishing Communities of Learning and Cultures of Thinking by Carol Brooks Simoneau and Gerald Bailey.</h2><h2><strong>Instructor Descriptions</strong></h2><h2>Accompanying each task is a backend &quot;Instructor Description.&quot; Each Instructor Description is only intended for the instructor or facilitator of the module and not the educator participating as a learner in the module.

To help World Language Educators accomplish this, the Nebraska Department of Education invited experienced world language teachers across the state to create student-friendly assessments in the form of can-do statements in the summer of 2023.&nbsp;This document is a student-friendly self-assessment activity for Advanced Low world language learners created based on the 2019 Nebraska World Language Standards.

Our goal is to encourage informed thinking about (why) language matters, so that you can continue puzzling about language issues long after you&#39;ve worked your way through this book.<br />Now in its third edition,&nbsp;the book is packed with over 100 commented activities, examples of language play, and fun food for thought, designed to whet your appetite for linguistics and language studies.<br />The companion workbook, <em>Lang101 Workbook</em>,&nbsp;contains 460 additional commented exercises and activities, designed for self-study or for the classroom.</font></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>";;;community-college-lower-division|adult-education;higher-education|linguistics;curriculum-instruction|professional-development;en;Linguistics|Multilingualism|Multilingual Students|Textbook;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0;cc-by;;;Full Course;student|teacher;2020-04-16T08:18:20 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Module;; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Textbook;;

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21295/overview;Use of Cultural Brokers As an Approach to Community Engagement With African American Families in Child Welfare.;"<p>This empirically based curriculum addresses a number of issues related to disparity and disproportionality experienced by African American families involved with child welfare. It is well documented that for decades African American children have been overrepresented in child welfare throughout this country. Yet little is known about what strategies might be implemented in order to reverse this phenomenon. This curriculum is based on findings from a Community-Based Participatory Research Project that brought together African American community leaders and university faculty to examine both the historical evolution and prominent features of a cultural broker approach to promote engagement and partnership with the African American community and the county child welfare agency. This curriculum provides research highlights, historical perspectives, conceptual frameworks, approaches for community engagement, tools and experiential opportunities to strengthen social worker understanding, and knowledge and skills regarding issues related to disproportionality and disparity experienced by African American families in child welfare. It addresses five areas: the history of cultural racism and oppression in child welfare, the prevalence of racial disparities and disproportionality in child welfare, the role of community partnership and collaboration with African American families in child welfare service delivery, the cultural broker approach to community engagement in child welfare practice, and key considerations for improved child welfare partnerships with African American communities.

The language use described in all can-do statements is meant for the target language, except for the second for standard 3.1 and the first for standard 4.2.&nbsp;It is recommended that world language teachers engage students with this document three times in an academic year: pre-course, mid-course, and post-course. Engaging students with this self-assessment activity will help students see growth over time and hopefully attribute growth to effective learning practices.

It provides students with a sample memorandum to review for communications effectiveness. Then, by using a freely downloadable screen reader (and/or an enabled text-to-talk feature) and an embedded accessibility checker, students will evaluate the accessibility of the sample memo. With an altered appreciation of audience (now aware of sight-impairment disability), students will revise the memo using universal design principles and best practices for creating accessible documents. Using those experiences, students will be guided to reflect upon other disabilities and accommodations in the workplace. Finally, students will explore ability privileges and create a plan to identify, monitor and control blind spots. |&nbsp;</span></span></span>Introductory <a href=""https://mma.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=25cc996c-7cd9-46bb-b20f-abe40112926c"">except from a presentation</a> at the Eastern Academy of Management on 26 June 2020 | <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/119lkMnBZYecO4PzsvRS-9WO1VTbOpLSW/view?usp=share_link"">Appendix containing ideas for modifying the exercise</a></p>";;;community-college-lower-division|college-upper-division|graduate-professional|adult-education;business-and-communication|communication|management;;en;;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/;cc-by-nc;;;Activity/Lab;;2020-01-03T09:00:50 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Interactive;;

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21294/overview;Family Reunification Among Mexican and Vietnamese Immigrant Children in the Child Welfare System: Toward an Understanding of Promising Practices to Improve Service Availability and Effectiveness.;"<p>National, state, or local-level data are limited with respect to the characteristics of immigrant children in the child welfare system, the proportion of immigrant children who reunify, or the constellation of services that may be associated with family reunification among immigrant families. To fill these gaps in the literature, practice, and policy, this project examined family reunification among Mexican and Vietnamese immigrant and non-immigrant children and identified promising practices to improve service availability and effectiveness. This study used quantitative and qualitative methods and was conducted in two counties in Northern California. This curriculum has five overall goals: (a) to understand common characteristics among Mexican and Vietnamese immigrant families in the U.S. and California and connections among parenting and acculturation; (b) to understand distinctive characteristics of Mexican and Vietnamese immigrants in the child welfare system, compared to non-immigrants; (c) to understand factors that contribute to reunification among Mexican and Vietnamese immigrant families involved in family reunification services; (d) to understand how the work of a child welfare worker influences service availability for Mexican and Vietnamese immigrant families; and (e) to understand the basic components of cultural competence and how these relate to service effectiveness with immigrant families involved in the child welfare system.

https://oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/21293/overview;Using Publicly Available Data to Engage IV-E Students in Research and Statistics: Instructional Modules.;"<p>Increasingly, public agencies are adopting models of self-assessment in which administrative data are used to guide and then continuously evaluate the implementation of programs and policies. In California, public child welfare agencies track performance outcomes spanning a range of child safety, permanency, and well-being domains, as dictated by federal and state mandates. This curriculum has been designed to provide Title IV-E and others students interested in public child welfare systems with an overview of the state&rsquo;s Child Welfare Outcomes and Accountability System. Students will be provided with hands-on opportunities to become experienced and &ldquo;statistically literate&rdquo; users of aggregate, public child welfare data from the state&rsquo;s administrative child welfare system, attending to the often missing link between data/research and practice. This curriculum is organized into five teaching modules, providing instructors with student learning activities, PowerPoint slide presentations, and other materials to support graduate IV-E students in the development of practical data analysis skills. Materials focus on publicly available data hosted through the Child Welfare Indicators Project at the University of California at Berkeley, a long-standing agency/university data partnership:&nbsp;<a href=""http://cssr.berkeley.edu/ucb_childwelfare"">http://cssr.berkeley.edu/ucb_childwelfare</a>. CalSWEC funding for the development of this curriculum was provided to the Child Welfare Performance Indicators Project. Modules were developed to support instructors of both first- and second-year MSW research courses. Module objectives include: (a) to support student (and instructor) understanding of California&#39;s child welfare system performance goals and progress to date; (b) to develop students who have highly desirable (and practical) data analysis skills, including the ability to intelligibly distill and present numerical findings; and (c) to prepare a cohort of IV-E MSW students equipped to adopt leadership roles in county child welfare agencies, bringing with them an appreciation for how data can be used to improve practice and inform policies.&nbsp;</p><p>Putnam-Hornstein, E., Needell, B., Lery, B., King, B., &amp; Weigmann, W.

Apparently so, judging by the ways people keep talking about them. This is the first book that discusses, in light-hearted lay terms, the reasons behind the beliefs and myths about multilinguals that allow you to fill the blank in its title with almost any label and get away with it. Drawing on solid academic research, the book provides keys to the origin and endurance of the many intriguing names that multilinguals have been called, starting with the master-key to them all. The conclusion is that any oddities assigned to multilinguals are due to the language that is used to talk about them, not to multilingual behaviour itself.
